    <h8> Governance in Brasília</h8>
  </header>
  <main>

    <h2>The city and its environs - paths of socio-ecological transformation, needs for action and governance structures
      in the urban-environs context</h2>

    <p1>The capital Brasília was initially considered a model for a planned city foundation (Kaiser 1987). As Brasília
      developed into a center of attraction due to its high standard of living, the population limit of 500,000 planned
      by Lúcio Costa could not be met. Urban settlement areas expanded beyond the boundaries of the newly created
      federal district (Deckker 2015). Today, there are numerous satellite cities in the area that are larger in
      population than the Plano Piloto itself, but the utopian notion of the perfect city was never achieved. The
      attempt to classify a metropolitan region around the capital city of Brasília is characterized by the term <I>Área
        Metropolitana de Brasília </I> (AMB) (Holanda 2015).According to Holanda, unlike metropolitan areas in other
      parts of the world, the AMB has a high degree of fragmentation, with a highly dispersed urban fabric. The problem
      of urban sprawl is due to government policies and planning. With the <I>Região Integrada do DF e Entorno</I>
      (RIDE), the
      state intended to promote cooperation among peripheral municipalities in neighboring states (Distrito Federal
      2014), since some peripheral municipalities have a strong interest in functional cooperation.</p1>

    <h2>Research question & used methods:</h2>

    <p>The socioeconomic contrasts as well as urban planning and planning aspects of the DF have been investigated and
      analyzed in numerous studies. In contrast, the large-scale development of the metropolitan region has been little
      researched. This is the point that this contribution aims to address, with the research question:
      <br>How does Brasília, in its capacity as capital city, manage inter-municipal cooperation and the spatial
      development of the metropolis?<br>
      In order to better understand the role of the Federal District and its current challenges, it is important to take
      a closer look at the administrative structures.

      <br><I>• What collaborations exist between the Federal District and the surrounding municipalities? </I>
      <br><I>• How can the Brasília metropolitan region be spatially delineated?</I>
      <br>In order to find this out, primarily existing literature was evaluated and open content aspects on site were
      covered with expert interviews. Furthermore, on a smaller scale, local observations and walk-throughs were
      conducted in the administrative regions of Ceilândia and Samambaia. Due to the complexity of the topic and the
      short development history of Brasília, the literature research was limited by the small literature spectrum.
    </p>

    <h2>The special character of the Districto Federal:</h2>

    <p>
      Meaning of Districto Federal (DF): Due to its hybrid character as an administrative body, the DF contains
      competences to act at the federal level and at the state level. It is divided into 31 <I>Regiões
        administrativas</I>,
      including the central administrative zone of Plano Piloto. In addition, the DF has a special status under the
      Constitution (1988) in that it is prohibited from governing autonomous municipalities. The active decision-maker
      is the Governor of the <I>Distrito Federal</I> and his representatives. Since the DF includes state and municipal
      powers,
      they cannot be separated, which makes the aforementioned administrative regions dependent on the governor of the
      DF. The surrounding states, on the other hand, have a state constitution with autonomous municipalities.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance structures and areas of action:</h2>

    <p>
      <B>NOVACAP (Companhia Urbanizadora da Nova Capital do Brasil) (1956):</B> State-created authority that had a
      headquarters in a city that did not yet exist in the beginning. Main actor for all development processes in the
      spatial production (landowner) of the <I>Distrito Federal</I> and single decision maker for all administrative
      matters
      possesses bureaucratic self-government right in the urbanization process. NOVACAP was considered the sole owner of
      almost all the land in the new Distrito Federal until 1964. Consequently, the institution retained any right to
      act as an independent decision-maker. With bureaucratic authority, NOVACAP was able to decide how the capital city
      would continuously expand in its development. This includes, among other things, the course of development of
      future business locations or industrial sites. The role as the main actor in the state's interest to control the
      development process in the socioeconomic context show the result of incidents of abuse of authority in the sense
      of corruption allegations within the area of responsibility from land acquisition and land allocation. One of the
      central tasks in the newly formed Distrito Federal was to communalize the land market by buying up the entire land
      area. The intended nationalization of land ownership by the Federal Government in order to be able to carry out
      unimpeded implementation of planning administration has not been settled to date. The unresolved ownership issues
      highlight the current different types of land ownership in the state, such as private ownership or expropriated
      land. They pose a problem not only for the administrative structure, but also for settlement development (Bose
      2017).
      <br><br>
      <B>TERRACAP (Companhia Imobiliária de Brasília) (1973):</B> Authority that manages the land area in the DF as a
      public decision maker and administrator, acting in the interest of the capital administration (1960) Governo do
      Distrito Federal. The fields of action include the areas such as building permits for space production and
      concession granting (Fig. 1-6) (Terracap 2022).

      <br><B>SUDECO (Superintendencia do Desenvolvimento do Centro – Oeste) (1967):</B> Is a regulatory agency that
      monitors the development trajectory of the Midwest. The goal is to drive sustainable socioeconomic transformation
      with Midwest State Constitutional Funds (FCO).

      <h2>What happened in the region?</h2>
      <p>The DF has the highest growth of population in Brazil and a strongly increasing wealth. It is now the 3rd
        largest metropolitan area in the country. The surrounding municipalities of the DF form a belt of
        underdevelopment. This periphery grew with all those who cannot afford to live in the Plano Piloto. This is
        easily seen in the distribution of average income and completed college degrees in the region. Most of the
        residents of the surrounding municipalities work in the DF, or the jobs in the municipalities depend on the
        officials of the capital who live there (Sasse 2020).<br>
        The emerging problems due to the increase in people are only solvable through public policies, job creation and
        infrastructure development. But until now, no way has been found to integrate these municipalities around the DF
        and create a metropolitan region. In fact, there is an institutional mess, there has been research, debates,
        political negotiations and projects for legal support and integration of the region, but little has been done in
        practice. Integration of the periphery needs a functioning institutional arrangement, and it needs agreement on
        the actual size of the DF's sphere of influence. To create an integrated region, there have been different
        approaches to delineate the region and, in addition, attempts to create a legal legitimacy/foundation for the
        region (Paviani 2019).

        <br><B>1998:<I><a href="#ride">Região Integrada do Districto Federal e Entorno (RIDE)</a></I></B> (fig. 7) was
        created,
        it initially consisted of 21 municipalities and was expanded to 33 in 2018. The intention was to build a
        socio-economic relationship between the neighboring states of the <B><I>Entorno</I></B> and the Federal
        District. RIDE is a
        governing board for the development of the area surrounding the Federal District. However, the gigantism of
        RIDE, do not make its operation easy. RIDE's successes have been rather minimal, and many projects have been
        reinstated or have never been implemented (fig. 8) (Distrito Federal 2014).

        the construction of an interconnection network that should enable the progress of socio-economic transformation
        within the periphery. It is hoped to foster regional cooperation and promote stagnant regional development.
        However, the members of the AMB do not recognize the existence of RIDE and no public policy is established
        (Paviani 2019).

        (Sasse 2020).</p>

      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



      <h2>What happened in regional development?</h2>
      <p>
        <B>Cooperation:</B><br>Intermunicipal cooperation does not exist in an official way, because coordination
        between neighboring municipalities is difficult, even coordination within the DF works in a limited way.
        Accordingly, the top-down problem emerges. As a result of the fact that official forms of regulation do not
        work, special-purpose associations are formed out of necessity to cooperate on a sectoral and topic-specific
        basis. Especially in the waste management and health sector (Carvalho de Souza 2022 & Pires 2022).

        <br><B>Finances:</B><br>The federal district receives tax funds for self-government of the region. The available
        financial resources should be transferred to neighboring municipalities in the interest of regional development.
        However, the money remains in Brasília, which is used for non-priority projects (fig. 11). The inconsistencies
        in the regulation of financial resources lead to contrasts and social fragmentation within the region (Carvalho
        de Souza 2022).

        <br><br><B>Economic Pivot:</B><br>To strengthen the region as an economic unit, as is found between <I>São
          Paulo</I>
        and <I>Rio de Janeiro</I>, this is sparsely promoted in the Distrito Federal between its neighboring states. The
        only
        economic axis <I><B>Eixo</B></I> has existed between <I>Anápolis-Goiânia</I> since the founding of Brasília
        (fig. 12).

        <figure>

            alt="Figure 12: Eixo Brasília-Anápolis-Goiânia Source: Projeções E Dados Atuais Sobre O Eixo Econômico (2022).">

        </p10><br>

        The spatial construct, with <I>Brasília</I> as the functional center towards the west to <I>Goiânia</I>, is a
        particular
        model. The association of a cooperative collaboration reflects the creation of an industrial interdependence
        space. With existing spatial resources (e.g. agricultural land) in the nearby hinterland, the region developed
        into a dynamic economic sector, especially in the agricultural industry as a grain producer (e.g. soy, corn) or
        in the pharmaceutical and automotive industries. Due to the increasing importance as an economic axis, the
        spatial structure evolved, influencing the integration of interlaying cities, such as <I>Anápolis</I> in their
        valorization and importance. The city of <I>Anápolis</I> thus developed into a polycentric center, which, as the
        logistical center of the Central - West region, represents a central role for future infrastructural
        interdependencies and developments. It should be emphasized that such interconnectedness promotes the
        socioeconomic transformation path inside and outside the <I>Distrito Federal</I>. Due to the low level of
        political
        interest, Brasília is discarding the opportunity to act as an economic hub for the central West. The possibility
        to expand the stagnant development would be to promote <I>Anápolis</I> as a new hub due to its favorable
        position to
        its neighboring states (Pires 2022).

      </p>




      <h2>Conclusion</h2>

      <p>
        At the moment <I>Brasília</I> hardly controls inter-municipal cooperation and spatial development of the metropolitan
        region, since all projects and schemes are not implemented or fail. Therefore, Sudeco, as the superintendence
        for the development of the Midwest, should be strengthened so that resources are targeted. Sudeco, <I>Goiás</I> and DF
        have not been able to work out a joint solution to date. Nevertheless, there is a need to work together to find
        solutions so that political rivalries are resolved. According to the Experts these are the main factors the
        region is progressing so slowly in its development and being abandoned by many action representatives. Consortia
        are needed to manage the region (waste, health, etc.). The amendment of the Constitution (PEC) allows delimiting
        micro-regions around cities with more than one million inhabitants. The goal is to integrate the organization,
        planning and execution of public tasks of common interest. Funds would be used exclusively to finance
        infrastructure investments and costs in the metropolitan region (Sasse 2020, Paviani 2019, Carvalho de Souza
        2022 & Pires 2022).
