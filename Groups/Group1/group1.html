    <h2>Research question and topic</h2>
    <p> <I>What forms of space appropriation are visible in the Plano Piloto and in what way can the construct of
        planned, produced space create urbanity? <br>
        How is space appropriation and urbanity happening in selected
        places?</I> <br>
      These questions arose when the research about Brasília and its core, the Plano Piloto, started. One of the first
      difficulties encountered during the research process was the eurocentric perspective held by the student
      researchers regarding the construct of a ‘city’. This had to constantly be kept in mind, since it would otherwise
      have compromised a neutral research process. </p>

    <h2>Theory</h2>

    <p>The concept of urbanity is diverse and hard to define; a definition based solely on the size of a city (number of
      citizens & footprint) is not enough (Wirth 2020). Urbanity can be translated as a cognitive construct; the
      collective identity of a place and lifestyles that evolve from it, regardless of whether a city is defined by
      administrative standards, or it being just a rural community. <br>
      Given this context, the city of Brasília stands out as it is a planned city, the new capital of a rising state,
      and a promise to society of better days to come (Stierli 2013). However, the Brasília of today struggles with
      uncontrolled growth and spatial segregation, which makes it almost impossible to live a life without a car due to
      the planning being based on the separation of social functions (Bezerra et al. 2017). The aspiration to build a
      modern capital with new forms of community living and social integration failed, as nowadays many citizens live in
      satellite cities up to 50 km away from the city centre, the so-called <B>Plano Piloto</B> (Cafrune 2016). In
      contrast to the city development of Brasília, Brazil was one of the first countries to legitimate the Right to the
      City in a national law, the <I>Estatuto da Cidade</I> (Mengay and Pricelius 2011), which was issued to stand
      against spatial and social segregation. <br>
      The urban aspect of a collective identity of a place stands out in Brasília, not only within Brazil, but globally.
      People came from all over the country to settle in this new city in the middle of the <I>cerrado</I>, a dry
      plateau in
      the backcountry, with almost no pre-existing infrastructure. It was designed by Oscar Niemeyer as a symbol of
      modern times, to show the evolving modern Brazilian society. Now, two generations later, one might expect to
      encounter a version of Brasília as a thriving and inspiring capital, much more than just the administrative heart
      of a huge country. However, old metropolitan centres like São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro still define the typical
      charisma of the Brazilian city. This does not mean it does not exist in Brasília, but one has to look more
      closely, and to always keep in mind the history of Brasília and how society there has formed since the
      independence of Brazil <a class="link_name" href="/pages/About Brasilia/aboutbrasilia.html"> (see About
        Brasília)</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 id="results">Results and interpretation with theoretical reference </h2>

    <p>
      The architect Oscar Niemeyer and Lúcio Costa, the urban planner behind the construction of Brasília wanted to
      build an icon of modernity to manifest the evolving Brazilian society of the modern era. The planning of Brasília
      was based on the separation of social functions, which at the time was considered to be the most modern way of
      living. The modern society - as Niemeyer perceived it - was based on access to modern technology, which at that
      time meant to be able to use automobiles without limitation <a class="link_name"
        href="/pages/About Brasilia/aboutbrasilia.html">(see About Brasília)</a></li>. The segregation of the
      Brazilian
      society of today is based on the limited access to functions because of limited means, which can be seen in the
      use of public transport by lower income groups and the domination of the informal sector in the Rodoviária
      (central bus / metro station) in contrast to the Conjunto Nacional (shopping mall) <a class="link_name"
        href="/Groups/Group5/group5.html">(see Mobility in Brasília)</a></li>. With the change of global
      societies through increased environmental awareness and the breakup
      of social norms and values all over the world, Brasília seems like a remnant of the modern times of acceleration
      (Williams 2007). The transition to the postmodern era needs yet to be implemented but is bound by the planning of
      Niemeyer/Costa. One could say that Brasília as an icon of modernity does not serve the already existing postmodern
      society of contemporary Brazil anymore and only fortifies the growing segregation within its society (Kaiser 1987,
      Wehrhahn 1998, Struck 2017).<br>
      Due to the decentralization of the city by the separation of functions, it is difficult to identify an actual core
      of the city within the <B>Plano Piloto</B>. During the research progress, it was decided to envisage the core of
      Brasília
      to be the <B>tricentre</B>, consisting of the Rodoviária, the Edifício Conic (a cultural, shopping and service
      centre)
      and the Conjunto Nacional, and to subsequently compare this tricentre with the Vila Planalto neighbourhood. The
      following results are based on the interpreted findings resulting from the application of several different
      <a href="#methods">methods</a> used in the fieldwork.
      <br><br>
      Making urbanity comprehensible is not easy. The concept of the city within the city according to Ungers and
      Kolhaas (1977) - describes a polycentric form of organisation, an ‘archipelago‘ of differences so to speak, which
      favours urbanity. According to this understanding, today's cities cannot be understood as a whole, but as a
      complex structure with many different ‘islands’ which all have different characters. Urbanity thus meets in
      condensed form in the ‘islands’. If we apply this concept to Brasília, we can identify various such ‘islands’.
      Firstly, the area around the Rodoviária, the Edifício Conic, and the Conjunto Nacional can be identified as a
      special place for urbanity. In addition, the Vila Planalto neighbourhood is of great relevance considering its
      history as a former residential area of construction workers. It is known as one of the most diverse
      neighbourhoods in Brasília. This refers to the income differences, the diversity of the residents, as well as that
      of the architecture. Urbanity is often associated with diversity, so <B>Vila Planalto</B> is an appealing
      neighbourhood
      for research. Through the method of strollology/walking <a href="#methods">(see methods chapter)</a>, this
      impression was consolidated.
      Important aspects of urbanity are human presence and interaction, green spaces and consumption opportunities, as
      well as the influence and diversity of subcultures (see diagram). Attributes that were mentioned during the
      fieldwork in connection with urbanity were ‘dense/full‘ or ‘diverse/different‘. At the same time, however, Vila
      Planalto was also described as ‘familiar, upper-class, and chic‘ as well as ‘quiet, stress-free, and pleasant‘
      (see diagram). This discrepancy shows how different the perceptions of the neighbourhood are. In <a
        class="link_name" href="/pages/map/map.html">the map</a></li>, some
      photos which were taken during the walks are shown and explained in a wider context. <br>
      In summary, Vila Planalto is one of the rare places where the inhabitants successfully fought the planning by the
      government. Within the ‘island’ of Vila Planalto, individualism, participation, space appropriation, and
      subculture are quite visible, which indicates a vivid urban life. Although different perceptions such as emptiness
      or ‘chicness’ underline the diversity and complexity of the area. In contrast to other ‘islands’ in Brasília, Vila
      Planalto more closely follows the Western image of a neighbourhood as well as the understanding of urbanity
      including different architectural structures, restaurants, and life in public spaces. One could argue that it is
      the counterweight to the strictly planned area of the Plano Piloto, which is also geographically very close to all
      central functions.

      <br><br>
      Within the context of urbanity, keywords such as ‘dense’ and ‘anonymous’ are some of the main aspects of urban
      living. The <B>Rodoviária</B> <a href="#methods">(methods: observation and mapping)</a> might seem as a place of
      futile exchanges between
      people, but it does serve as a regular meeting point not only for mobility, but also consumption, since the
      informal sector is quite dominant here. The informal sector is tolerated, even though the authorities are present;
      it almost seems as if there is a symbiotic co-existence. Moreover, knowing that the car is the dominant means of
      transport in Brasília amongst members of the upper socioeconomic class, it can be concluded that this space is
      predominantly frequented by people from lower income groups (Holanda 2022). <br><br>
      </p><p id="conic">
      The <B>Edifício Conic</B> <a href="#methods">(methods: interview, mapping, walks)</a> was once a place where
      urbanity was shaped by
      strolling. Until the late 1980s, it was home to several small theatres, restaurants, pubs, cafés, etc. According
      to Lúcio Costa, it was designed to have a sort of “Mediterranean atmosphere” where the public could spend evenings
      as a community. However, due to lack of financial investment, the sense of place changed, with sex work settling
      in vacant spaces. Today, restaurants or snack shops and a bar are visible in a few places. Otherwise, the place is
      dominated by vacancy, retail, party offices, churches, and private clinics. In addition, events such as concerts
      take place from time to time (Rossi 2022). However, the Edifício Conic and its surroundings present a security
      risk, especially in the evenings, which is in contrast with the semi-public Conjunto National which is guarded by
      security guards, and subject to strict opening hours. The Edifício Conic and its surroundings stand out in the
      tricentre because of its subcultural character, which can be seen in the numerous graffities and murals.<br><br>

      </figure>




      <br>The third point of the core, the <B>Conjunto Nacional</B> <a href="#methods">(methods: walks)</a>, may be the most inviting place
      to stroll around for the following reasons: As a shopping centre it seems primarily to be a place of consumption,
      however, the compulsion to buy does not exist and furthermore, it is a secure and climatized place through which
      one can stroll, meet friends, or spend a lunch break. Technically it is not a public space, since there are rules
      and security, but in a segregated country like Brazil this could be a factor for the appeal of secured,
      semi-public places like the Conjunto Nacional. The combination of security, air-conditioning, visual diversity of
      the shops, and the restaurant level give people the opportunity to spend a whole day as a leisure activity
      (Rückert 2002). Compared to the Rodoviária, the informal sector is completely absent in the Conjunto Nacional,
      which leads to the conclusion that it is used on average by higher-income groups. However, this would have to be
      the subject of further investigations.

      <br><br>

      The colliding and coexisting of different ways of living make Brasília special in its own way. Urbanity almost
      seems raw, like something that already put down roots, but got overtaken by the rapid evolution of society and the
      new standards and needs of a modern city life. Thus, it struggles to grow and blossom. In conclusion, urbanity can
      be perceived in the different locations of the tricentre as well as in Vila Planalto. As a construct that
      distinguishes the urban from the rural, it is produced by the inhabitants of Brasília. Compared to European cities
      such as Amsterdam (see the Lévy model (2020)), urbanity is less related to a concrete centre and occurs
      selectively. Different groups of people and incomes create diverse forms and expressions of urbanity in various
      places (Salin 2020), some of which exist side-by-side, but separately from each other as ‘islands’. In some
      places, political activism is a sign of urbanity (Salin 2020), while urbanity can also be recognisable in the form
      of (e.g. political) graffiti. Looking at each of these places in isolation, the time of day is an equally
      influential factor. At the Rodoviária, the informal sector creates liveliness at daytime, while at the Edifício
      Conic, a bar creates urbanity at night - especially on weekends. Vila Planalto is highly frequented during
      lunchtime. Other places where urbanity can be perceived in Brasília are the Comércios Locais – local centres of
      the respective super quadras <a class="link_name" href="/Groups/Group4/group4.html">(see Plano Piloto:
        Daily Life)</a></li> , or green spaces such as the Parque da Cidade – the
      city park of Brasília <a class="link_name" href="/Groups/Group2/group2.html">(see Leisure & Open
        Space)</a></li>.

    <h2 id="methods">Methods and limitations of the methods</h2>

    <p id="strollology">

      In order to approach the question of spatial perception and use in regard to urbanity, a <B>'strollology
        method'</B> was
      used: specifically, the 'continuous stop walking method' based on Schultz and van Etteger (2017). Strolls were
      conducted in the area of Vila Planalto <a class="link_name" href="/pages/map/map.html">(see route on
        map)</a></li>. This area was chosen because of its relevance to
      urbanity, which was highlighted in the literature and in interviews with experts. The method was carried out on
      25.04.2022 with five students. The first walk (from 10 a.m.) was carried out continuously and documented by
      writing down impressions and experiences afterwards. Then (from 12 p.m.), the same route was walked again. This
      time however, breaks were taken at regular intervals to let the surroundings take effect and to facilitate the
      documentation of the experience via photos and notes. These data were then evaluated with qualitative analyses,
      visualised, and summarised. Some of them are shown on <a class="link_name" href="/pages/map/map.html">the
        map</a></li> and in the <a href="#figure">diagrams above</a>. The difficulty within
      this method was the framing such as the time of day or weather conditions, and also the Eurocentric view on
      urbanity of the European students, and the limitations stemming from individual concentration spans. Therefore,
      the role of subjectivity must be kept in mind, even though guiding questions were given to mitigate this aspect.
      For further research, walks on different days and times as well as more non-European participants are recommended,
      in order to expand the data. <br></p>
    <p id="tricentre">
      The results for the <B>tricentre</B> are based on a mix of methods consisting of observations at the Rodoviária,
      mapping
      of the ground floor level of the Rodoviária as well as the ground floor level of the Edifício Conic, and an
      interview with Taína Rossi about the significance of the Edifício Conic. In addition, walks took place in both the
      Edifício Conic and the Conjunto Nacional to gather further impressions. <br></p>
    <p id="observations">
      At the Rodoviária, a total of four covert, non-participatory <B>observations</B> (Thierbach and Petschick 2014)
      were made
      on two days (Saturday, 23.04.22 and Tuesday, 26.04.22) in the morning (from 10 a.m.) and afternoon (from 1:30
      p.m.) for 60 minutes each. They were carried out by four people observing each time. For this, the students had an
      observation sheet with set categories. Some of the criteria are: characteristics of people, subcultural
      expression, appropriation of space, interaction. Supporting videos (on saturday at the section D; on tuesday at
      the section B) were taken showing the frequency of visitors (difference between morning and afternoon) as well as
      the presence of the informal sector.<br></p>
    <p id="mapping"></p>
    The <B>mapping</B> of the ground floor level of the Rodoviária was carried out on Saturday 23.04.22 at 12:00. The
    purpose
    of the mapping was to provide a visual aspect to the observations (Olbrich et al. 2002). A limitation here is that
    the informal sector, in the form of street vendors, is only present at certain times of the day. This factor can
    be countered by labelling the dynamic elements (informal sector), but these change both over the course of a day
    and across the days of the week. Accordingly, not all elements are clearly ascertainable and thus the mappings
    only offer a momentary insight. The mapping of the ground floor level of the Edifício Conic was done on Thursday,
    28.04.22 at around lunchtime. Compared to the Rodoviária, there are almost no dynamic elements (informal sector).
    Although this mapping is also only a momentary insight, changes in terms of vacancy in parts of the building are
    easier to understand due to the building structure. As a supplement, the type of spatial use and the
    (comprehensible) price level were noted.

    <p id="interview"></p>
    The <B>interview</B> regarding the changing role of the Edifício Conic with
    Taína Rossi took place on 28.04.22 and is based on three guiding questions: 1. Which meaning does the Conic have
    for youth and subculture? 2. Has it always been the same since the foundation of Brasília? How do older
    generations perceive this place? 3. Is the Conic a place where you like to spend time? Rossi’s answers were well
    coordinated with the questions, but certain limitations lay in the fact that follow-up questions could not be
    asked ad hoc, only separately. The responses to the questions are used for the interpretation of the role of the
    Edifício Conic <a href="#results">(see Results)</a>.

    Originally, an additional method was also planned: a <B>photo-interview</B> where, through
    the use of lime survey and a QR-Code, people could show their most-frequented place via a photograph.
    Unfortunately, the degree of participation was low. This might be due to the technical inconvenience of not having
    a camera at hand. This was adapted during the research project phase by also giving participants the option to
    simply describe their most frequented place via text, but this did not bring better results. As the Brazilian
    culture is very interactive, the one-sided nature of a survey on a smartphone with no feedback might have been the
    cause of the failure.
