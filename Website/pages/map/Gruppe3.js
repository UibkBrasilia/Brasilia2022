        about: "Inner-city gated communities are mainly large apartment complexes with walls and strict access controls which have extensive utilities and leisure infrastructure and thus enable their residents to live a large part of their everyday life within the compound. That means that most of the condomínios fechados verticais are secured by walls, video surveillance and doormen. This living arrangement is based on the concepts of spatialisation of (in)security and space-oriented security policies. These security strategies led to the creation of vertical gated communities for the middle class, meaning that only people who live there have access to the apartment buildings and their communal amenities.6 Within these condomínios fechados verticais, residents must pay operating costs called “condomínio” in order to use infrastructure and common areas. The condomínio’s cost varies greatly, with a mean cost of R$ 771.94, a minimum of R$ 70 and a maximum of R$ 2800 per month. The question arises as to what causes this difference and whether it is influenced by the size of the flat, the number of rooms, or the number of floors. According to Fernando Luiz Araújo Sobrinho (professor of geography at the UNB), the infrastructure is decisive to the cost of the condomínio. He regards swimming pools, chapels, green spaces, and other communal facilities as infrastructure.",

        about: "In Águas Claras, in contrast to the Plano Piloto, no systematic division of the city into spatially separated (basic) functional areas was implemented in the sense of the Athens Charter.11 When the Plano Piloto was built in the 1960s, architects and urban planners were still enthusiastic about the functional division of cities. From the 1990s onwards - at the time of the founding of Águas Claras - the model of sustainable urban development envolved out of the problems of this perspective, and with it came a more environmentally compatible approach to urban planning. Three central points are now considered particularly important: 1. density in urban development, 2. mixed usage and 3. polycentricity. All three of these characteristics are prevalent in the structure of Águas Claras. The compact, high-quality building structures exploit the utilisation potential within the city and densify the inner city. The functional mix achieved through the interweaving of housing, work, supply, education and leisure promotes the new guiding principle of the so-called (city of short distances). The principle of polycentricity is based on decentralised planning of the city so that there is no concentration in the city centre.3,9 These theoretical features can certainly be found in Águas Claras. As can be seen in this map, no single functional area dominates in all six areas surveyed, but rather there is a mixture of branches and services in each of them. This may be one reason for the generally high level of satisfaction of the residents surveyed regarding their everyday supply, as all their needs can be met near to their place of residence.",

        about: "The fact that there are buildings with up to 30 storeys is due to a change of governor and the resulting change in building regulations in the Federal District. According to Fernando Luiz Araújo Sobrinho (professor of geography at the UNB), the vice governor at the time was one of the largest building contractors in the Distrito Federal, who was therefore interested in a massive increase in the number of storeys per building. Fernando Luiz Araújo Sobrinho explained how this was also favoured by the fact that at that time, the demand for appropriate living spaces for the middle class of the population had increased considerably. This phenomenon of living densification through verticalization in the form of high-rise buildings is in accordance with the concept of sustainable urban development, which has been an important guiding principle in urban planning since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in 1992. One of the guiding or organising principles of this concept is to create compact, yet high-quality built structures within a city to prevent settlements from sprawling, which is possible through densification and verticalization.11 Whether this concept, profit-driven motivations, or the demand for housing was the driving force for verticalization is unknown, and therefore a matter for further investigations.",

        about: "Another indication of whether the respondents or the inhabitants of Águas Claras can be considered to be “middle class” is the presence of service staff. Enquiries were made in this regard as part of the survey. Of the 49 respondents, 25 stated that they employ a cleaning person (diarista), while 18 stated that they employ no service personnel. Only three of the respondents stated that they employ a housekeeper (empregada) who also lives in the household; two people also have housekeepers who do not live in the household. It is questionable whether these results can be used to identify or define a middle class however, because according to Fernando Luiz Araújo Sobrinho (professor of geography at the UNB), society is changing, meaning that empregadas are used less and less, although diaristas are still part of the (customs of middle-class families in Brasília, but also in Europe).",

        about: "In Águas Claras, the concept of functionalism was not applied; instead, the concept of sustainable urban development was applied, which focuses not only on urban densification but also on a functional mix.11 Partzsch16 published a universally valid catalogue of the seven basic functions of existence based on the so-called (Munich school of social geography). This catalogue identifies the elements (living), (work), (supply and disposal), (educate yourself), (to recover), (participate in traffic) and (live in community). This catalogue is still used to research urban conditions in order to explain the different spatial structural patterns of a society.14,22 In the context of the research project, the investigation of the spatial structural patterns focused specifically on the functions of (living) and (supply and disposal). For this purpose, sub-aspects of the mapping were selected, and density distribution maps were created to clarify whether or not there is a concentration of businesses offering the same products in Águas Claras. The sub-aspects are gastronomic supply (bars, restaurants, cafés and street food stalls), food and everyday supply (shopping centres, grocery stores, weekly markets and specialised food stores) and other supply (real estate companies, medical services and other services).",

The sub-aspects in this map are gastronomic supplies (bars, restaurants, cafés and street food stalls). Looking at the distribution patterns of food and everyday supply facilities, it is noticeable that bars are mainly concentrated around the Águas Claras and Arniqueiras metro stations, but with a focus around the Águas Claras station. The situation is similar for cafés, with a focus around Arniqueiras station. Since these two types of supply facilities are not related to the satisfaction of basic needs, but rather to the satisfaction of the basic function of (live in community), it is not surprising that for these the choice of location was influenced by the convenient location to the metro and not by the proximity to the consumers. In terms of spatial distribution, a form of agglomeration or clustering can also be seen. This form of agglomeration can certainly have advantages, as these branches of luxury consumption certainly thrive on passing customers and the agglomeration thus creates an atmosphere for potential customers where they have the greatest possible choice.7 Restaurants, on the other hand, are somewhat better distributed within the mapping area, although here too there is an agglomeration in the eastern area around the Arniqueiras metro station. Nevertheless, unlike the cafés and bars, there are also several restaurants in the easternmost part of the mapping area. This could be due to the fact that there are mainly apartment buildings and hardly any office buildings in this area, and that restaurants are mainly focused on evening dining or on proximity to consumers.7 In the case of mobile street food stalls, an interpretation can only take place via the location chosen at the time of mapping. Here it can be seen that street food stands are mainly concentrated in the western part of the mapping areas. An interpretive approach would explain this situation as the stalls being primarily located around the office buildings, which are mainly concentrated around the more westerly Águas Claras metro station. Again, the location factor of proximity to the consumer would come into play.",

The sub-aspects in this map are food and everyday supplies (shopping centres, grocery stores, weekly markets and specialised food stores). The spatial distribution of daily (food) supply shows a different picture. The buildings identified as shopping centres can be seen across the entire mapping area without any recognisable areas of increased density. Most of them, with the exception of the shopping centre (Águas Claras Shopping), are smaller shopping centres, galleries and arcades. These correspond to the type “city-integrated shopping centres”.10 The distribution of grocery stores seems to be similar to the distribution of shopping centres, although there are signs of a concentration of grocery stores in the centre of the mapping area, and thus between the metro stations. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that the distribution pattern was created by businesses taking advantage of the proximity to potential customers and the convenient location along the main roads parallel to the metro line.10 Specialised food stores such as organic food shops, bakeries, butchers, etc. are distributed sporadically throughout the city and are also concentrated around the Águas Claras metro station and to the west and east of the (Águas Claras Shopping) shopping centre. There are also a few specialised food stores to the northwest and southeast of the Arniqueiras metro station. Again, the same location factors as for grocery stores will have been relevant in the choice of location - proximity to customers and convenient location.",

The sub-aspects in this map are other supplies (real estate companies, medical services and other services). With regard to the other utilities, the spatial distribution of the real estate companies should be evaluated at the beginning. This type of service, which provides residents with housing, is offered in Águas Claras - mainly south of the metro line. Comparing the distribution pattern with the map of housing, it seems that real estate companies are located close to larger open spaces that are most likely to be built on in the coming years. Thus, the real estate companies are not close to their customers, but rather close to the business resource - undeveloped land.7 Other services such as cosmetic-related services (hairdressers, barbers, nail and beauty salons), non-food specialised stores (pet shops, office supplies, gift items, etc.) and other specialised stores (clothing and shoe shops) are present to the east of the Águas Claras metro station and between the two metro stations, but there are also agglomerations of these services to the northeast, northwest and south of the Arniqueiras metro station. These are mainly located along the main roads and in places where walk-in customers are expected, such as near parking areas and public lounges.10 The medical care facilities consist of specialised doctors such as orthodontists, cosmetic surgeons, dentists and dermatologists, consultation centres, pharmacies and a private hospital. In the spatial distribution pattern, it is noticeable that hardly any such medical care facilities are located within the mapping area. Only one private hospital south of the metro station Águas Claras could be mapped, and neither emergency clinics nor public hospitals were located within the mapping area.

Thus, there is a tendency towards home cooking, which means that people have to regularly stock up their provisions of everyday goods. Fernando Luiz Araújo Sobrinho (professor of geography at the UNB), who lives in Águas Claras, also confirms the hypothesis that the residents of Águas Claras often cook for themselves. A special feature of the last few years, however, was the pandemic, which of course radically changed habits, leading to people eating at home more often.",

On average, respondents visit a medical facility less than once a year. How often medical facilities are visited is not related to age or employment status.

This correlates with the general trend in the Distro Federal, as the Plano Piloto was designed primarily for individual transport and is largely used as such. The metro plays only a minor role in everyday supply, probably also due to the fact that it is only moderately well developed. In addition, social status also plays a decisive role in the choice of transport. Fernando Luiz Araújo Sobrinho (professor of geography at the UNB) said that his students would be frightened if they saw him in the metro. Those who can afford a car also use it for all their journeys. As a result, there are always traffic problems, especially at peak times, when there are often traffic jams. When reaching supply facilities, a distinction is made between three categories of transport – motorised individual transport (car, moped motorbike etc.), non-motorised individual transport (bicycle or on foot) and public transport. The purpose of the journey is to get to and from grocery shops. The resulting total transport effort is referred to in transport geography as modal split. The survey showed that on average it takes respondents about 5 to 15 minutes, but often 15-30 minutes, to get to grocery stores. Almost half of them use their car, about 30% walk, and about 15% use public transport.",

This satisfaction picture is also reflected in the following statements of the respondents: [...] We need a good public hospital or Here in Águas Claras we need a public hospital and also a health centre. The people who live here have to go to Taguatinga or Guará. However, some people have a completely opposite view and are satisfied with this level of care: “Yes. I don't think improvements are needed and some voices, while speaking in favour of general satisfaction, have suggestions for improvement: „In general yes, but we have to move further afield only for less common or in-demand specialities” or “As for the private hospital, yes. But there is no public hospital and no health centre.”. It seems that people with private health insurance in Águas Claras are adequately covered and that there are enough private hospitals and health centres. Consequently, it could be concluded from these statements that people with private health insurance in Águas Claras are adequately covered and that there are enough private hospitals and health facilities. However, if people are insured through the public health system (SUS), they are less satisfied with this general availability. When asked about the medical services in Águas Claras compared to the Plano Piloto, 35% of people said they see them as equal and conversely 35% would describe them as worse. How satisfied respondents are with the medical facilities is not related to age or highest level of education, but satisfaction is related to primary employment status - and therefore possibly again to the insurance system - as well as to age.
