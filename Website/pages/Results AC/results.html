  <p1> When Lucio Costa realised his vision of Brazil's new capital, 
    the architectural guiding principles were primarily of western-modern origin. 
    These principles eventually led to the creation of more and more satellite cities around Brasília 
    in the following decades, to compensate for the lack of infrastructure and housing options available 
    to the ever-growing population of the Federal District of Brazil. Águas Claras is one of the youngest
     administrative regions and was designed in the 1990s by architect and urban planner Paulo Zimbres, 
     with the aim of meeting the still steadily growing demand for living space. The aim was to create 
     more living space on less land area by means of building high-rise complexes.19 Águas Claras is 
     currently one of the fastest growing urban areas in the Federal District and has been an independent 
     administrative region since 20035, yet several questions arise when considering its development and 
     role within Brasilia: How does Águas Claras, which was planned in the 1990s, differ from the Plano 
     Piloto in terms of living, medical care and everyday supply? Is the period in which a planned city 
     is created decisive to the development of supply structures? How were the residents of Águas Claras 
     able to leave their mark on the space?</p1>

     <p2>To understand how the living situation in Águas Claras can be explained, it must first be understood 
      that the planning of Águas Claras was based on a linear city model. This model is characterised by the 
      fact that the settlement in question is built along a straight line provided by transportation 
      infrastructure (in the case of Águas Claras, the metro). This results in an unlimited expansion of the
       settlement space or urban development along a linear path, as well as a close connection between 
       urban and natural spaces (such as the Parque Ecológico de Águas Claras) in the direction tangential 
       to the main infrastructural axis.13,9,20 Mapping of a predefined area (fig. 1) shows that Águas 
       Claras presents itself as a highly condensed and verticalized city. The lowest buildings are six 
       storeys high. On average, most buildings have between eleven and twenty floors and the tallest 
       building has 30 floors. It seems that there is no clear concentration of particularly high or 
       low residential buildings; rather, the number of floors seems to be left to the discretion of 
       the architects and builders. However, this was also favoured by the fact that at that time the 
       demand for appropriate living for the middle class of the population had increased considerably.
       1 The phenomenon of living densification through verticalization in the form of high-rise buildings 
       reflects the concept of sustainable urban development.11 The majority of the living complexes are 
       separated from public areas via walls, video surveillance, and doormen. This practise can be 
       explained by the concept of spatialisation of (in)security and space-oriented security policies. 
       These security strategies led to the creation of vertical gated communities (condomínios fechados 
       verticais) for the middle class, so that only condomínio-paying residents have access to the
        apartment buildings and their communal amenities.5,6 A survey of residents of Águas Claras as 
        well as interviews with experts revealed the housing situation inside the apartment buildings: 
        the value or the rental price of the flat increases with the verticality. That means that flats 
        on the upper floors of a building, which may have the same floor plan as the flats on the lowest 
        floors, cost significantly more. The primary reasons for this are the noise from the streets on 
        the lower floors, and the cooler temperatures, better lighting and better view on the upper floors.
         On the upper levels there are also often large apartments spanning across two or three floors.
         1 Almost 75% of the respondents stated that they own their own apartments; the others live in 
         rented flats. This figure is an indication that mainly people of the middle class live in 
         Águas Claras. Respondents reported having between one and seven rooms in their home, with 
         the mean value being around three rooms, and the median footprint of the apartments being 82m². 
         The size of the flat generally increases with the number of people in the household, with the 
         number of children playing an especially large role. From the information provided by the survey 
         it can also be concluded that partner households predominate. If there are children living in 
         the household, there is mostly only one child.</p2>

         <p3>
          In contrast to the Plano Piloto, the concept of functionalism was not applied in Águas Claras. 
          In fact, the problems associated with the earlier functionalist model gave rise to a guiding 
          principle of sustainable urban development and thus to more environmentally compatible urban 
          planning. This principle focuses on urban densification and on a functional mix, thus creating a 
          so-called city of short distances.11,9,20 Via mapping, surveys and interviews, it was investigated 
          how this functional mix is reflected in the existing supply structures, and to what extent the 
          residents make use of these amenities. Sub-aspects of these investigations are gastronomic supply 
          (bars, restaurants, cafés and street food stalls), food and everyday supply (shopping centres, 
          grocery stores, weekly markets and specialised food stores) and other supply (real estate companies, 
          medical services and other services).7 From the results of the mapping, density distribution maps of 
          the sub-aspects were created in order to find out which supply structures are available to residents. 
          When it comes to accessing supply facilities, a distinction is made between three categories: 
          motorised individual transport (car, moped motorbike etc.), non-motorised individual transport 
          (bicycle or walking) and public transport, which is also referred to as modal split.12 The results 
          of the survey show how these existing supply strategies are used and which means of transport were 
          chosen.
