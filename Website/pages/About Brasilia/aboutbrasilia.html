    <h1>
      Capital History of Brazil
    </h1>
    <p>
      Brazil is considered a country of superlatives and disparities, so it is hardly surprising that the capital city
      Brasília is also in many regards exceptional even amongst other capital cities, boasting a wide range of unique
      and fascinating dynamics. However, it is not only the processes that are currently at work in the city that are
      important, but also the background and the history of Brasília (Anhuf & Coy 2017).<br>
      Brazil's first capitals were located on the coast: Salvador de Bahia was capital from 1549-1763 and Rio de Janeiro
      from 1763 -1960. The core decision that a new Brazilian capital should abandon any coastal location and go far
      inland was already made with the foundation of the Republic in 1889 (Struck 2017). The city was to be built in the
      Midwest, towards the centre of the country. For generations, many places in the Midwest lived in almost complete
      isolation because of the enormous distances between them and the coast, and because of the lack of transportation
      links. These factors led to these regions developing a unique provincial lifestyle. In the 20th century, with the
      construction of the new capital, this changed. Most importantly, it changed the perception of the Midwest. Even
      though politically, economically, and culturally many activities still took place in the coastal zones of the
      Southeast or Northeast, the Midwest was increasingly seen as a region which represented the “real, genuine”
      Brazil. <I>Brasilidade</I> - Brazilian identity - was increasing in the rustic, rural, purist Midwest. More attention was
      paid to the interior (Coy 2013).<br>
      The growing population in the peripheral interior had to be managed and supplied. With agricultural colonization
      and settlement advancing westward and the rubber boom in Amazonia, the relocation of the capital was also a
      strategy towards securing resources militarily and establishing better economic and transportation links. It
      therefore seemed essential to erect a new capital in the interior of the country as a centre of power and as an
      economic hub. 
      <h1>Planning a New Capital</h1>
      Where exactly the new capital was to be located, however, was long disputed, and it was not until
      1948 that the final building site for Brasília was determined. The capital city project was closely linked to the
      policy of the transition to modernity pursued by President Juscelino Kubitschek (since 1956). Part of his agenda
      was technical progress, which was to be initiated by large-scale infrastructural projects. The project planning
      was a joint project of the urban planner Lúcio Costa and the architect Oscar Niemeyer (Struck 2017).<br>
      Building Brasília was part of Kubitschek’s "fifty years of prosperity in five" plan. Designed in the shape of an
      airplane, the city was inaugurated as Brazil’s capital in 1960, after just 41 months of building. Immediately
      afterwards, legislation was passed to preserve the original layout, known as the <I>Plano Piloto</I>, restricting the
      growth of housing markets near the city centre (Dowall & Monkkonen 2007). The basic idea was based on the shape of
      the cross, formed by the intersection of the two main axes. On the monumental axis, political and cultural
      institutions are located, as well as the cathedral. At its end is the political centre: the Square of the Three
      Powers, the Presidential Palace, and the lake. The second axis is reserved for residential purposes with housing
      units - the superquadras - which were intended to form their own neighbourhoods and are equipped with central
      services. This model was intended to establish the utopia of an ideal city, via the concept of the functional
      city. Furthermore, the socialist paradigm, which proclaims equality for all citizens, was followed. At the same
      time, automobiles were prioritised, and the city was planned with a deliberately low population density. Brasília
      was promoted as the "City of Hope" and was intended to stand out as a vision for a new Brazilian society, freed
      from social inequality (Struck 2017).<br>
      <h1>Realizing the Plan</h1>
      But how did the plan turn out? Even during the construction phase, spontaneous settlements sprang up around the
      Plano Piloto to house construction workers and basic service providers. Later, these settlements grew into
      satellite towns due to the lack of housing within the <I>Plano Piloto</I> structure (Struck 2017). Years later in
      December 1987, at the request of then-Governor José Aparecido de Oliveira, Brasília’s <I>Plano Piloto</I> was registered
      with UNESCO as a World Heritage site, making the area the first 20th century monument to achieve the protection of
      the United Nations. Despite the architectural significance of the city’s master plan, the rigid restrictions on
      urban development in Brasília have engendered perverse effects on the spatial distribution of the metropolitan
      area’s inhabitants and patterns of urban development.<br>
      In this context, Brasília, and in broader sense Distrito Federal, still consists of an extremely static core and
      an exceedingly dynamic periphery (Dowall & Monkkonen 2007). Contemporary challenges thus include the lack of
      supra-regional governance, which is further complicated by the administrative division into municipalities and
      federal state (Costa & Lee 2019). Furthermore, Brasília faces issues like water resource management caused by
      land-use and landcover change (Lorz et al 2012), housing shortage because of the imbalance between demand and
      stock (Samuels 2010) and also the problem of misconduct towards minorities, especially by disrespecting and
      degrading indigenous rights (Hanna et al 2016). Even though most of the world societies perceive the climate
      change and its effects, Brasília doesn´t seem prepared for the climate change consequences and is far behind in
      terms of climate protection and adaptation and in terms of sustainable urban development (Ford et al 2011). These
      issues can be seen for example in Brasília´s mobility management: There are hardly no pedestrian walkways or bike
      lanes, multi-lane motorways, etc. (Do Caromo Bezerra et al 2017). Additionally, there are other challenges of
      daily life like accessibility of open spaces, maintenance of protected areas, management of supply and the
      creation of urbanity. Therefore, our research has been working on these topics among others (see topics) –
      including historical heritage and it´s influence on recent every-day life in Brasília and it´s surroundings.<br>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      In conclusion, there are many advocates of Brasília who see great potential for the future in the city. One has
      also to consider the recent presidential elections and their impact on spatial and socio-economic development in
      Brasília as well as in Brazil. However, it can also be stated that the inequalities in the Brazilian population as
      a whole have not decreased as hoped. The essential social change has therefore failed to materialize, despite
      Brazil becoming economically stronger (Struck 2017). Brasília is therefore considered by some to be an artifact of
      modernity, possibly even a failed utopia, but nevertheless it remains an exciting city that offers much potential
      for research.
