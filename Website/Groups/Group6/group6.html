    <h8> Governance in Brasília</h8>
  </header>
  <main>

    <h2>The city and its environs - paths of socio-ecological transformation needs for action and governance structures in the urban-environs context</h2>

    <p1> The new capital Brasília was initially considered a model for a planned city foundation (Kaiser 1987). As Brasília developed into a center of attraction due to its high standard of living, the population limit of 500,000 planned by Lúcio Costa could not be met. Urban settlement areas expanded beyond the boundaries of the newly created federal district (Deckker 2015). Today, there are numerous satellite cities in the area that are larger in population than Brasília itself, but the utopian notion of the perfect city was never achieved. The attempt to classify a metropolitan region in the capital city of Brasília is characterized by the term Área Metropolitana de Brasília (AMB) (Holanda 2015). According to HOLANDA 2015, unlike metropolitan areas in other parts of the world, the AMB has a high degree of fragmentation, with a highly dispersed urban fabric. The problem of urban sprawl is due to government policies and planning. With the Região Integrada do DF (RIDE), the state intended to promote cooperation among peripheral municipalities in neighboring states (Distrito Federal 2014). Since some peripheral municipalities have a strong interest in functional cooperation.</p1>

    <h2>Research Question & Used Methods</h2>

    <p>The socioeconomic contrasts as well as urban planning and planning aspects of the DF have been investigated and analyzed in numerous studies. In contrast, the large-scale development of the metropolitan region has been little researched. This is the point that this paper aims to address, with the research question: 
      How does Brasília, in its capacity as capital city, manage inter-municipal cooperation and the spatial development of the metropolis?
      In order to better understand the role of the Federal District and its current challenges, it is important to take a closer look at the administrative structures. 
      <br>•	What collaborations exist between the Federal District and the surrounding municipalities? 
      <br>•	How can the Brasília metropolitan region be spatially delineated? 
      <br>In order to find this out, primarily existing literature was evaluated and open content aspects on site were covered with expert interviews. Furthermore, on a smaller scale, local observations and walk-throughs were conducted in the administrative regions of Ceilândia and Samambaia. Due to the complexity of the topic and the short development history of Brasília, the literature research was limited by the small literature spectrum.
    </p>

    <h2>Actors for the Development of the Metropolitan Region of Brasília</h2>

    <p>
      Meaning of Districto Federal (DF): Due to its hybrid character as an administrative body, the DF contains competences to act at the federal level and at the state level. It is divided into 31 administrative regions, including the central administrative zone of Brasília. In addition, the DF has a special status under the Constitution (1988) in that it is prohibited from governing autonomous municipalities. The active decision-maker is the Governor of the Districto Federal and his deputies. Since the DF includes state and municipal powers, they cannot be separated, which makes the aforementioned administrative regions dependent on the governor of the DF. The states, on the other hand, have a state constitution with autonomous Municipalities.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance structures and areas of action</h2>

    <p>
      <B>NOVACAP Companhia Urbanizadora da Nova Capital do Brasil (1956):</B> State-created authority that had a headquarters in a city that did not yet exist. Main actor for all development processes in the spatial production (landowner) of the Districto Federal and single decision maker for all administrative matters possesses bureaucratic self-government right in the urbanization process.
      <br>
      <B>TERRACAP Companhia Imobiliária de Brasília (1973): </B> Authority that manages the land area in the DF as a public decision maker and administrator, acting in the interest of the capital administration (1960) Governo do Distrito Federal. The fields of action include the areas such as building permits for space production and concession granting (Terracap 2022).
      <br>
      <B>SUDECO Superintendencia do Desenvolvimento do Centro – Oeste (1967): </B> Is a regulatory agency that monitors the development trajectory of the Midwest. The goal is to drive sustainable socioeconomic transformation with Midwest State Constitutional Funds (FCO).
    </p>

    <h2>What happened in the region?</h2>
    <p>The DF has the highest growth of Brazil (mainly from N-E) and a strongly increasing wealth. It is now the 3rd largest metropolitan area in the country. The surrounding municipalities of the DF form a belt of underdevelopment. This periphery grew with all those who cannot afford to live in Brasília. This is easily seen in the distribution of average income and completed college degrees in the region. Most of the residents of the surrounding municipalities work in the DF or the jobs in the municipalities depend on the officials of the capital who live there (Sasse 2020).<br>
      The emerging problems due to the increase in people are only solvable through public policies, job creation & infrastructure development. But until now, no way has been found to integrate these municipalities and create a metropolitan region. In fact, there is an institutional mess, there has been research, debates, political negotiations and projects for legal support and integration of the region, but little has been done in practice. Integration of the periphery needs a functioning institutional arrangement, and it needs agreement on the actual size of the DF's sphere of influence. To create an integrated region, there have been different approaches to delineate the region and, in addition, attempts to create a legal legitimacy/foundation for the region (Paviani 2019).
    </p>


    <h2>Experiments for an integrated region</h2><br>
    <img src='/Website/Groups/Group6/Bild1.png' alt="Attempts for an integrated region" style="float:left">
    <p>
      <br><B>1998: RIDE (Regiao Integrada do Districto Federal (RIDE))</B> was created, it initially consisted of 21 municipalities and was expanded to 33 in 2018. The intention was to build a socio-economic relationship between the neighboring states the <I>"Entorno"</I> and the Federal District. RIDE is a governing board for the development of the area surrounding the Federal District. However, the gigantism of RIDE, do not make its operation easy. RIDE's successes have been rather minimal and many projects have been reinstated or have never been implemented (Distrito Federal 2014).
      <br><br>
      <B>2008: </B>Constitutional amendment PEC 27/2008 federal supplementary law to be able to establish metropolitan regions.
      <br><br>
      <B>2014: </B>PEC 13/2014 federal supplementary law was revised again.
      <br><br>
      <B>2014:</B> In the codeplan, the <B><I>Area Metropolitana AMB</I></B>  was planned, this consists of 12 neighboring municipalities in Goiás. The metropolitan area serves as a template for the construction of an interconnection network that should enable the progress of socio-economic transformation within the periphery. It is hoped to foster regional cooperation and promote stagnant regional development. However, these do not recognize the existence of RIDE and no public policy is established (Paviani 2019).
      <br><br>
      <B>2015: </B>Metropolis Statute Law 13.089 for the creation of a metropolitan region, for which it requires federal authorization and public policy based on state laws and district law. Then-President Dilma Rousseff vetoes the law.
      <br><br>
      <B>2018: </B>Provisional Measure (MP) 862/2018 to amend the Metropolitan Statute to create the DF Metropolitan Region and surrounding municipalities. However, the MP must comply with the 1988 Constitution and the dispute over government funding FCDF & FCO blocked the MP. As a result, the MP lost validity and there are no new projects (Sasse 2020).
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
    
    <h2>What happened in regional development?</h2>
    <p>
      <B>Cooperation:</B><br>Intermunicipal cooperation does not excite in an official way, because coordination between neighboring municipalities is difficult, even coordination within the DF works in a limited way. Accordingly, the top-down problem emerges (Carvalho de Souza 2022 u. Pires 2022).
    <br><B>Finances:</B><br>The federal district receives tax funds for self-government of the region. The available financial resources should be transferred to neighboring municipalities in the interest of regional development. However, the money remains in Brasília, which is used for non-priority projects. The inconsistencies in the regulation of financial resources lead to contrasts and social fragmentation within the region (Carvalho de Souza 2022).
    <br><B>Economic Pivot:</B><br>To strengthen the region as an economic unit, as is found between São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, this is sparsely promoted in the Districto Federal between its neighboring states. The only economic axis "Eixo" has existed between Anápolis-Goiânia since the founding of Brasília. Due to the low level of political interest, Brasília is discarding the opportunity to act as an economic hub for the central West. The possibility to expand the stagnant development would be to promote Anápolis as a new hub due to its favorable position to its neighboring states (Pires 2022).
    
    </p>
    
    
    
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      At the moment, Brasília hardly controls inter-municipal cooperation and spatial development of the metropolitan region, since all projects and schemes are not implemented or fail. Therefore, Sudeco, as the superintendence for the development of the Midwest, should be strengthened so that resources are targeted. Sudeco, Goias & DF have not been able to work out a joint solution to date. Nevertheless, there is a need to work together to find solutions so that political rivalries are resolved. These are the result of the region stagnating in its development and being abandoned by many action representatives. Consortia are needed to manage the region (waste, health, etc.). The amendment of the Constitution (PEC), allows to delimit micro-regions around cities with more than one million inhabitants. The goal is to integrate the organization, planning and execution of public tasks of common interest. Funds would be used exclusively to finance infrastructure investments and costs in the metropolitan region (Sasse 2020, Paviani 2019, Carvalho de Souza 2022 u. Pires 2022).
