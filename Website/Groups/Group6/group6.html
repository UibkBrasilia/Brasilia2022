  <h8> Governance in Brasília</h8>
    </header>
    <main>
 
  <p1> The new capital Brasília was initially considered a model for a planned city foundation (cf. KAISER 1987). As Brasília developed into a centre of attraction due to its high standard of living, the population limit of 500,000 people planned by Lúcio Costa could not be met. The urban settlement areas expanded beyond the borders of the newly created federal district (cf. DECKKER 2015). Today, there are numerous satellite cities in this area that are larger in population than Brasília itself, but the utopian idea of the perfect city was never achieved. The attempt to classify a metropolitan region in the capital Brasília is characterised by the term "Área Metropolitana de Brasília" (AMB) (cf. HOLANDA et al. 2015). According to HOLANDA et al. (cf. 2015), in contrast to large cities in other parts of the world, the AMB has a high degree of fragmentation, with a highly dispersed urban fabric. The problem of urban sprawl is due to government policies and planning. With the "Região Integrada do DF (RIDE)", the state wanted to promote cooperation between the peripheral municipalities of neighbouring states (cf. DISTRITO FEDERAL 2014). As some peripheral municipalities have a strong interest in functional cooperation.</p1>

     <h1>Research question & methods used</h1>

     <p2>The socio-economic contrasts as well as urban planning and planning aspects of DF have been investigated and analysed in numerous studies. The large-scale development of the metropolitan region, on the other hand, has been little researched. This is the point of departure for this paper, with the research question: 
      How does Brasília, in its function as capital, manage inter-municipal cooperation and the spatial development of the metropolis?
      In order to better understand the role of the Federal District and its current challenges, it is important to take a closer look at the administrative structures. What cooperation exists between the federal district and the surrounding municipalities? How can the Brasília metropolitan region be spatially delimited? To find this out, literature was analysed and interviews with experts were conducted. Due to the complexity of the topic and the short history of Brazil's development, the literature review was limited by the small range of literature. In the expert interviews, the challenge was to find suitable experts and to adapt the respective guidelines.
      </p2>

         <h2>Actors involved in the development of the Brasília metropolitan region</h2>

         <p3>
          Importance of the Districto Federal: Structured in 31 administrative regions including the central administrative zone of Brasilia. In addition, the DF has a special status under the Constitution (1988) in that it is prohibited from running autonomous municipalities. The active decision-maker is the Governor of the Districto Federal and his deputies. Since the DF contains state and municipal powers, they cannot be separated, resulting in the aforementioned administrative regions being dependent on the governor of the DF. The federal states, on the other hand, have a state constitution with autonomous municipalities (municipios, i.e. administrative units that have self-government powers). 
         </p3>

         <h3>Governance structures and areas of action</h3>

  <p4>
    <p9>NOVACAP Companhia Urbanizadora da Nova Capital do Brasil (1956):</p9> State-created authority that had a seat in a city that did not yet exist. Main actor for all development processes in spatial production (land owner) of the Districto Federal and sole decision-maker for all administrative matters has bureaucratic self-governance rights in the urbanisation process.
<br><p9>Military dictatorship (1964) to (1985):</p9> Suppression of the role as autonomous decision-maker for all jurisdictions and the right of ownership over the land area in the DF. Currently NOVACAP still has influence as a public authority in the field of ecology.
<br><p9>TERRACAP Companhia Imobiliária de Brasília (1973):</p9> Authority that manages the land area in the DF as a public decision-maker and administrator, acting in the interest of the capital administration (1960) Governo do Distrito Federal. The fields of action include areas such as building permits, land production and concessions.
<br><p9>SUDECO:</p9> Superintendencia do Desenvolvimento do Centro - Oeste (1967) Supervisory authority over the development process of the Midwest.  The aim is to drive sustainable socio-economic transformation with state constitutional funds of the Midwest (FCO).
</p4>

<h3>What has happened in the region?</h3>
<p4>The DF has the highest growth in Brazil (mainly from N-E) and a strong increase in wealth. It is now the 3rd largest metropolitan area in the country. The surrounding municipalities of the DF form a belt of underdevelopment. This periphery grew with all those who cannot afford to live in Brasilia. This is well visible in the distribution of average income and completed university degrees in the region. Most of the residents of the surrounding municipalities work in the DF or the jobs in the municipalities depend on the civil servants of the capital who live there.
  The emerging problems due to the increase in people are only solvable through public policies, job creation & infrastructure development. But so far, no way has been found to integrate these communities and create a metropolitan region. Indeed, there is an institutional mess, there has been research, debates, political negotiations and projects to legally support and integrate the region, but little has been done in practice. The integration of the periphery needs a functioning institutional arrangement and there needs to be agreement on the actual size of the DF's sphere of influence. In order to create an integrated region, there have been different approaches to demarcate the region and additionally attempts to create a legal legitimacy/foundation for the region.

  <h4>Attempts for an integrated region</h4><br>
  <img src='/Website/Groups/Group6/Bild1.png' alt="Attempts for an integrated region" style="float:left">
  <p5>
    <p9>1998: RIDE (Regiao Integrada do Districto Federal (RIDE))</p9>  was created, it initially consisted of 21 municipalities and was expanded to 33 in 2018. The intention was to build a socio-economic relationship between the neighbouring states the "Entorno" and the Federal District. RIDE is a governing board for the development of the Federal District's environs. However, the gigantism of RIDE, do not make its operation easy. RIDE's successes have been minimal and many projects have been abandoned or never implemented.
<br><br> <p9>2008: Constitutional amendment PEC 27/2008</p9> federal supplementary law to be able to establish metropolitan regions.
<br><br><p9>2014: PEC 13/2014</p9> federal supplementary law was revised again.
<br><br><p9>2014:</p9> The <p9>Area Metropolitana AMB</p9> was planned in the Code Plan, this consists of 12 neighbouring municipalities in Goias. The metropolitan area serves as a template for the development of an interconnected network that will enable the progress of socio-economic transformation within the periphery. It is hoped to foster regional cooperation and promote stagnant regional development. However, they do not recognise the existence of RIDE and no public policy is created.
<br><br><p9>2015: Metropolis Statute Law 13.089 for the creation of a metropolitan region</p9>, for which federal empowerment and public policy based on state laws and district law is needed. But then-President Dilma Rousseff vetoes the law.
<br><br><p9>2018: provisional measure (MP) 862/2018</p9> to amend the Metropolitan Statute to create the DF Metropolitan Region and surrounding municipalities. However, the MP must comply with the 1988 Constitution and the dispute over government funding FCDF & FCO blocked the MP. As a result, the MP became invalid and there are no new projects.

    </p5>
<br><br><br>
  <h5>Conclusion</h5>

  <p6>
At the moment Brasília hardly controls inter-municipal cooperation and spatial development of the metropolitan region, as all projects and schemes are not implemented or fail. Therefore, <p9>Sudeco</p9>, a superintendence for the development of the Midwest, should be strengthened so that funds are targeted. However, Sudeco, Goias & DF could not work out a joint solution. Nevertheless, there is a need to work together to find solutions and rivalries need to be resolved. These have led to the region being abandoned. Consortia are needed to manage the region (waste, health, etc.). The constitutional amendment (PEC), allows for the delineation of micro-regions around cities with more than one million inhabitants. The aim is to integrate the organisation, planning and execution of public tasks of common interest. Funds would be used exclusively to finance infrastructure investments and costs in the metropolitan region.
