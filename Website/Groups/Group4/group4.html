    <h8> Local Supply Systems and Living
      in the Plano Piloto
    </h8>
  </header>
  <main>

    <p>
      The plan according to which the Plano Piloto was built didn't only include positions of buildings and roads but
      focused on how people would be using the created places as well. In this modernist city, living and working should
      not be mixed and the residential areas were therefore carefully planned. The plan included a detailed structure on
      where and how the inhabitants were supposed to design their everyday life regarding supply systems, medical care,
      educational institutions, faith sites and sports facilities (Madanelo 1996). We asked ourselves to what extent the
      implementation of care for the people of Plano Piloto corresponds to what was initially planned. To put the study
      in a broader context, a comparison is made with the supply structure in Águas Claras. Thus, the question, where
      are the similarities and differences in the supply of different areas within the Distrito Federals will be
      answered.</p>

    <h2>Supply Offer</h2>
    <p2>The following section will describe how the supply structure was initially planned and what it looks like today
      according to our data collection.</p2>
    <h1>How was the local supply planned?</h1>

    <p>In contrast to the largely unplanned settlements of the satellite towns, in Plano Piloto, especially in Asa Sul
      and Asa Norte, there were plans for the local supply of the residents. In the so-called <I>Superquadras</I> or
      rather in
      the communities of four <I>Superquadras</I>, the <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I>, there were schools, medical
      facilities,
      playgrounds, clubs, swimming pools, gyms, as well as small stores with local supply possibilities (Madanelo 1996).
      Most of the supply was to be covered by small local commercial areas, such as bakeries and butcher shops (Tattara
      2011). These are located in the <I>Comércio Local</I> (see Figure 1). This idea is underlined by the geographer
      Prof.
      Aldo Paviani saying that one <I>Comércio Local</I> should host everything, from a butcher shop to a shoemaker.
      A <I>Comércio Local</I> is always located between the two adjacent <I>Superquadras</I>. So, in principle one
      <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> has three <I>Comércio Locais</I> at its disposal (see Figure 6).
      <br><br>

      <p10><I>Figure 1: Comércio Local 306/307 sul. Source: own picture</I></p10>
      <br>A very closely related theory is Walter Christaller's theory of central places. It deals with consumption and
      spatial planning. Basically, the theory describes how an area-wide supply of the population with goods can be
      implemented in the shortest possible distances. It explains how supply centers are formed and how they relate to
      each other. The theory is based on the homo oeconomicus approach. Accordingly, a person always possesses all the
      information and favors the offer that makes the most sense (Popp 2020).
    </p>

    <h1>What does local supply look like today?</h1>

    <p>
      Compared to the 1960s, when life in Plano Piloto began, society and especially consumer behavior changed
      drastically. Even in Plano Piloto, today's supply structures look different to some extent. In order to determine
      the current local supply structures, the method of <B><a href="#mapping">mapping</a></B> was chosen. <br>
      With this method, the current structures of the local supply system could be traced. The mapping evaluations show
      that the <I>Comércio Locais</I> are still present and used. In addition, there are shopping centers that residents
      use.
      The <I>Comércio Locais</I> differ from each other in their specialization. Some <I>Comércio Locais</I> focus on
      clothing,
      specialty items or restaurants, while others are mainly heterogeneous. <br>
      The analysis of the <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> 107/307 & 108/308 Sul, for example, shows that clothing and other
      retail
      dominate (see figure 2). Meanwhile, in the <I>Comércio Locais</I> in the <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> 202/402 &
      203/403 Norte,
      most shops hosted bars and restaurants, with a non-negligible share of body services, such as hairdressers or
      beauty salons. For the third <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> (see figure 2), gastronomy and body services occupy an
      essential share of the commercial space. However, the major part is occupied by other services, which may be very
      different from each other. This category includes language or dancing schools, fitness centers or estate agencies.
      Another observation that can be made is that the share of food specialized retail or supermarkets is not
      represented, as they are scarce in these <I>Comércio Locais</I>. Nevertheless, all the mapped <I>Comércio
        Locais</I> present a
      specific diversity within their range.<br>
      <figure>
        <img src="/Website/Groups/Group4/UdV_Zusammenfassung_new.JPG"
          alt="Figure 2:Distribution of commercial activities in the mapped Unidade de Vizinhanças. Source: own figure">
      </figure>
      <p10><I>Figure 2:Distribution of commercial activities in the mapped Unidade de Vizinhanças. Source: own
          figure</I></p10>
      <br>In addition, it could be determined that the condition of the <I>Comércio Locais</I> differs. Based on the
      restaurants and stores' price range and the vacancies, the economic position of <I>Comércio Locais</I> can be
      concluded.
      During the mapping of the different <I>Comércio Locais</I>, we could observe that they were not the only spaces
      that
      hosted commercial activities, but that there were also shops along the Via W2 and the Via W3. These two streets
      extend from south to north in Asa Norte and Asa Sul.
    </p>


    <h1>What has changed?</h1>

    <p>
      In summary, it can be noted that the local supply system has changed a lot, but in Plano Piloto, the basic
      structures have been preserved until today. The <I>Comércio Locais</I> can still be seen as supply centers,
      following the
      central places theory, with the shopping centers increasingly competing concerning specialized retail. The
      economist Alexandre Brandão Costa, who we were able to talk to mentioned several times that big supermarkets,
      so-called <I>Hypermercados</I>, have become very important and that many people get their weekly groceries there.
      The
      range of services offered within the <I>Comércio Locais</I> varies greatly, but essential services are still
      available in
      each of the <I>Comércio Locais</I> we studied. It was also noticeable that there was no economic disparity in more
      distant <I>Comércio Locais</I>. Vacancies could be observed in nearly every <I>Comércio Local</I>, but only in
      some it there
      were numerous enough to show on our graph.<br>
      In conclusion, the supply offered in Plano Piloto has increased, specialized in some places and is increasingly
      controlled by the shopping centers. In addition, the importance of supermarkets, which now bundle most of the
      local supply, has changed considerably. Every <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> has at least one larger supermarket. Here, the
      results of our analysis overlap with those of Bezerra and Agner (2021). Following our hypotheses, it can be stated
      that long-term planning of the local supply with a general master plan is not possible and is strongly influenced
      by social and economic dynamics. Furthermore, it has been shown that the supply structure within Distrito Federal
      is very heterogeneous. <a class="link_name" href="/Website/Groups/Group3/group3.html">See here the supply in the
        satellite town of Águas Claras.</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Supply Demand</h2>
    <p>We've already learned about the supply structure in Plano Piloto and how it has changed. The following section
      will focus on how the inhabitants use this supply offer.
      <br>Besides looking at the development of the supply structure in Plano Piloto, a second focus was set on the
      demand of inhabitants concerning the main supply. This includes for example, where and how inhabitants of Plano
      Piloto are going grocery shopping, having lunch, and doing other basic supply activities nowadays. Therefore, two
      different methods were practiced: <B><a href="#questionnaires">questionnaires</a></B> and <B><a href="#trackings">tracking</a></B>. <br>
      Using the answers to the questionnaires, four different categories can be formed. The first question focuses on
      the type of market that people go to for grocery shopping. Even with only six people participating, various
      locations can be determined. This includes local organic markets, weekly organic fairs, bakeries, shops in the
      nearby <I>Comércio Local</I>, supermarkets and even wholesale at <I>Hypermercados</I>. The participants chose these locations
      based on quality, price, availability of parking spots and short distances to their apartments. Regarding where
      the participants are having their main meals, the answers range from eating at home, cooking at home, and taking
      it with them during the day to fast food, eating at restaurants depending on the day and using the cafeteria at
      the university. Most participants rarely order their food online, saying: "only if time is short," "only if money
      is left," or "only out of convenience."<br>
      By drawing a mental map, the participants were asked to display where they are buying their supplies in relation
      to their home, how they move between shopping and home, and how much time it takes them to get to different
      places.<br>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p10><I>Figure 3: Mental Map 1. Source: own figure</I></p10>

      <br>This mental map (see figure 3) presents that the person is living in a building where it takes 5 minutes to
      get to a supermarket and 5 minutes in the opposite direction to get to the chosen drugstore.
      <br>
      <figure>

      <p10><I>Figure 4: Mental Map 2. Source: own figure</I></p10>
      <br>This person's mental map (see figure 4) shows the name of a <I>Hypermercado "Atacadão"</I> and organic fairs in the
      middle of the map as the primary focus. The cloud in the top right corner shows that it takes the person about 20
      minutes to get to the shopping places. The cloud on the bottom left side says that the person is covering the
      distances on foot. In the cloud in the bottom right corner types of products are listed such as food, hygiene
      products and cleaning supplies.
      <br>

      </figure>
      <p10><I>Figure 5: Mental Map 3. Source: own figure</I></p10>
      <br>This map (see figure 5) shows the word <I>carro</I> in the center as a focus which means car. All words around this
      (fruits, vegetables, organic fairs, supermarkets, <I>Atacadão</I>, perishable and non-perishable food) are connected
      through the word "car." This indicates regular usage of a car to purchase supplies.
      Through the tracking method, the idea that was already given by the mental maps could be stated more precisely.
      Four participants tracked their everyday life for four days with an app called Strava on their Smartphones. This
      method aimed to see how far and where people living in Plano Piloto are moving during their everyday life to
      accomplish everything necessary. The following map (see figure 6) shows the routes of all four participants. The
      fact that none of the participants left Plano Piloto during the tracking is very striking. The green track of
      person 2 has the most diverse route, whereas the red track of person 1 is mainly commuting between two different
      areas of Plano Piloto and seems to be moving by car. The pink track of person 4 is the only one moving in between
      Asa Sul and Asa Norte. This person also seems to be moving by car due to long distances and straight tracks along
      main roads. The blue track of person 3 shows a minor movement. If you want to know more about the mobility of
      people in Plano Piloto, <a class="link_name" href="/Website/Groups/Group5/group5.html">click here</a>.

    </p>
    <h1>What has changed?</h1>
    <p>
      Let us start with what has stayed basically the same so far. Considering the participants of questionnaires and
      tracking, it seems that the <I>Comércio Locais</I> still have an essential status especially since they are close to the
      apartments. The participants seem to enjoy a variety of supply offers that can be easily provided in a supply
      structure as is given in the Plano Piloto. What has changed is the presence of <I>Hypermercados</I> that are even bigger
      than the supermarkets in the <I>Comércio Locais</I>. These can usually attract people with lower prices, a wide range of
      offers and plenty of parking spaces. Over time, some new shopping centers have also been built in Plano Piloto and
      its border. Looking at the map of the tracking method and the questionnaires, it is obvious that people move
      further than only to their connecting <I>Comércio Local</I> to supply. The original plan for residents to walk to the
      adjoining <I>Comércio Locais</I> for supplies is therefore no longer being exercised.

    </p>

    <h2>Living in Plano Piloto</h2>

    <p>
      It has become clear that the <I>Superquadras</I> form the residential space in the Plano Piloto. They were thought of by
      Lucio Costa as living quarters where functions are separated. Furthermore, everything should be available, from
      medical care to schools, religious buildings, sporting facilities, everyday supply and space for leisure, such as
      playgrounds. The ideal <I>Superquadra</I> should also have communal green spaces and should always have between eight and
      eleven buildings. The urbanist and architect Prof. Sérgio Jatobá furthermore told us that another important aspect
      was the separation from traffic. A <I>Superquadra</I> can only be entered and left by car from one street. This way only
      residents enter the <I>Superquadra</I> and it is protected from transit traffic. <br>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p10><I>Figure 7: Unidade de Vizinhança, the model Superquadra. Source: Belo Ferreira 2013</I></p10>
      
      <br>Figure 7 shows us how Costa imagined how the <I>Superquadras</I> should look like and how the separation of functions
      looks on a spatial level. During our mappings and our visits of different <I>Superquadras</I> we could recognize all
      these traits. But the condition of the buildings and facilities differed from one <I>Superquadra</I> to another. This
      could be an indicator of the financial background of its residents or the success of communal efforts.<br>
      In order to learn more about everyday life in Plano Piloto we sat down with people who live there. Different
      aspects were aborded during these discussions, such as the architecture of the buildings, the communal living or
      the organization of the people living in Plano Piloto.

      <p10><I>Figure 8: Builduing I of the Superquadra 313 norte. Source: own figure</I></p10>
      <br>While visiting Bruno who lives in one of the first <I>Superquadras</I> in Asa Sul, we were able to have a look into
      an apartment that had hardly changed since its construction. Bruno told us that many people changed the interior
      design of their apartments and that only a few wanted to preserve the style of Oscar Niemeyer. From the outside,
      everything corresponded to the initial plan. The building has two elevators for its residents and a service
      elevator. Even if Brasília should eliminate the division between social classes, the residents used to have
      housekeepers who lived with them and, for example, used these service elevators. Nowadays, these elevators are
      used by construction workers. A resident, Gilney, who lives in a <I>Superquadra</I> in Asa Norte told us that people
      still have housekeepers but that they no longer live with their employers but are commuting to Plano Piloto from
      the satellite cities. This brings the lower classes together with the middle class because the housekeepers bring
      their kids to Plano Piloto during the day and go to the same schools as the children of middle-class families.
      Bruno, who has been living in Plano Piloto for a long time, told us that the residents from one building select
      one spokesperson, whose task is to represent the building and its residents on an administrative basis. He named
      examples like waste management systems that the residents wanted to implement. As for the visited <I>Superquadra</I> in
      Asa Norte, the buildings didn't look alike; every building had a different facade. The buildings were built later
      than the model <I>Superquadra</I> in Asa Sul, and no strict rules were applied concerning the looks. According to the
      residents, Plano Piloto is mainly populated by the Brazilian middle class.
      <br>Nevertheless, we were told that up until recently, there was not a close neighbourhood community. However,
      some residents were eager to change, throwing different projects like fruit trees accessible to all or a cofounded
      playground for the children. Not all the residents participate in communal life. This division is often being
      caused by different political beliefs which can sometimes lead to tension.<br>
      The apartment in Asa Norte was newly renovated, and the structure has been changed from its initial form. Here the
      changes were more of a practical nature than an aesthetic. We could also observe differences in the state of
      building by visiting different <I>Superquadras</I> and <I>Comércio Locais</I>. Some were in good shape, especially the original
      <I>Superquadras</I>. Nevertheless, within a <I>Superquadra</I>, there were differences between the buildings and occasional
      renovation works could be seen. The buildings in the <I>Comércio Locais</I> vary not only in their state but also in
      their design. So are the buildings in the <I>Comércio Locais</I> of Asa Sul only one story tall and continuous all along
      the street, with two to three passages. The <I>Comércio Locais</I> in Asa Norte are characterized by four to five, three
      stories tall, buildings on every side of the road. These structures have basements, sometimes hosting businesses
      or being used as storage. The buildings are accessible from all sides and are designed to maximize commercial
      space. In some cases, the upper Stories were inhabited (people on the balcony or doorbells). These apartments are
      known to be cheaper and often are inhabited by people who work in the businesses of the <I>Comércio Local</I>. Some
      <I>Superquadras</I> have a large number of students living in them. Often residents sub-rent rooms and alter the interior
      of the apartments in order to sub rent parts of them.<br>
      Every building in a <I>Superquadra</I> usually has security surveillance; some buildings even have a concierge. Other
      remnants from the original <I>Superquadra</I> plans are the Bancas, or Kiosks and critical services, which can still be
      found in every <I>Superquadra</I>. As we could see during our visits to different <I>Superquadras</I>, they differ regarding the
      common areas and the spaces between the buildings. Some <I>Superquadras</I> are equipped with sporting facilities or
      playgrounds while others don't have such spaces or they are in a desolate state.
      <br> According to Bruno, around 95% of the population of Plano Piloto have a car and use it in everyday life. The
      emergence of the automobile as the primary way of mobility during the second half of the 20th century had a
      consequence that the shops in the <I>Comércio Locais</I> faced the street and not as intended originally towards the
      residential buildings. Finally we have to mention the characteristic pillars on which stand the different
      buildings in the <I>Superquadras</I>.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      Looking at how Plano Piloto residents supply themselves daily, it becomes clear that social and economic dynamics
      influence commercial spaces and activities. Developments like the digitalization of our everyday life are
      processes that could not have been included in the ideas of Costa and Niemeyer when they were thinking of how the
      inhabitants would supply themselves. Offer and demand are ever-changing and so is society, and both influence each
      other. The initially planned commercial spaces still exist today and are used as such, but they don't seem to
      fulfill the needs. This is shown by the emergence of various shopping centers and bigger supermarkets. The
      diversity within most <I>Comércio Locais</I> ensures that the inhabitants theoretically can meet their needs, such as
      intended, but personal preferences are not considered.<br>
      As a consequence, residents visit other <I>Comércio Locais</I> or other commercial spaces within the Plano Piloto in
      order to find what they want. This can be seen in the mental maps and in the tracking data. This observation leads
      us to believe that the planners thought that supply habits could be planned or shaped in some way, not considering
      the residents' individuality and their needs. It is essential to emphasize the dynamic character of such needs and
      the interdependence of such with societal changes. <br>
      The preceding statements and the collected data don't legitimize general rulings but can point in a particular
      direction. This lets us conclude that the idea of the <I>Comércio Locais</I> and their role as supply hubs for the
      surrounding residents still exists today, but it failed to take into account the individuality of people and the
      impact of a growing consumer society.<br>
      Moreover, the Plano Piloto failed to generate inclusive living space for all of Brazils social classes. The poor
      live in the satellite cities as commute to the Plano Piloto to work. The Plano Piloto seems to be a stronghold of
      the middle class. But even this class, that lives together in the <I>Superquadras</I> is divided by politics as Gilney
      told us. Communal life is happening bottom up but fails to include all the residents and varies from <I>Superquadra</I>
      to another. <br>
      In comparison with the satellite town of Águas Claras, where we can also see a heterogenous mix concerning shops
      and supply possibilities, the biggest difference seems to be the residential buildings and their communal
      organization. For more details concerning Águas Claras, click here.

    <h2>Methods</h2>

    <p id="questionnaires">
      The <B>questionnaires</B> were handed out to students of the UNB who live in Plano Piloto, such as to random pedestrians
      we met while mapping the <I>Comércio Locais</I>. The total number of filled-out questionnaires is six, three men and
      three women between the ages of 23 and 65. The questionnaire contained five open questions, one drawing section
      for a mental map ending with some demographic questions about age, gender, living situation, number of people
      living in the same apartment and if they are working and/or studying. <br>
      This method could provide an overview of different opinions and practices. With only six people answering in
      total, we cannot take any conclusions for general habits out of the results. In order to still use the filled-out
      questionnaires, all answers were collected and sorted into a table that provides an overview of different habits
      concerning each topic of the questions asked. The mental maps were analyzed and compared.</p><br><br>
      
      <p id="trackings">
      The <B>trackings</B> were practiced by four people living in Plano Piloto. Three males and one female between 23 and 35
      years old. They were given an account for an app called Strava. With this app, people usually track their sporting
      activities (e.g., running: route, distance, speed, elevation, heart rate). For this study, the focus was only on
      the route they covered. After setting up their smartphone with the Strava app and given account, they started a
      tracking activity on Strava but continued their everyday life just as they would without tracking. The tracking
      was active for four days with breaks at night. The participants could also stop and start the tracking at any time
      and any place if they wanted to. These trackings resulted in exportable routes about the movement of the tracked
      people. Like this, it's possible to see if they go to the same <I>Comércio Local</I> every day, to different ones around
      their <I>Superquadra</I> and further away, if they leave Plano Piloto if they stop at a supermarket while on their way
      from A to B, etc. Figure 6 shows the different tracks of the four participants during their four days of tracking.
    </p><br><br>
    <p id="mapping">
    In human geography, <B>mapping</B> is seen as a special form of observation. With their help, spatial surveys can be
      created (Mattissek et al. 2013). Mapping aims to generate spatial location combined with specific characteristics
      using primary data for a delimited unit (Fülling et al. 2021). A total of 12 <I>Superquadras</I> were selected for our
      Mapping. Considering that four <I>Superquadras</I> results in one <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I>, a total of three <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> were examined, including both the housing units and the <I>Comércio Locais</I> within and adjacent to them. A
      mapping key was prepared in advance. This is divided into the following sections: gastronomy, food specialized
      retail, supermarket, body services, drugstore, other services, clothing, other retail, doctors, pets and vacancy.
      During data collection, the position, area, exact name, details and price range were noted in each case. In the
      analysis, the individual results of the respective <I>Comércio Locais</I> and <I>Unidade de Vizinhança</I> were then quantified
      to determine which sectors predominated.</p><br><br>

      <p id="interviews"></p>
      As a fourth method, we must name the <B>interviews</B> that we had with two residents from Plano Piloto. Bruno and Gilney
      live in Asa Sul, respectively, in Asa Norte and each one of them invited us to their <I>Superquadra</I> to discuss life
      in Plano Piloto. These visits and discussions happened in an explorative manner. We tried to understand everyday
      life in the different <I>Superquadras</I> of Brasília.</p>
