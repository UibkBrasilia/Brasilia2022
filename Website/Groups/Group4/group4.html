    <h8> Everyday Life in Plano Piloto</h8>
  </header>
  <main>

    <p1>
      The plan according to which the Plano Piloto was built didn't only include positions of buildings and roads. It focused on how people would be using the created places as well. The plan included a detailed structute on where and how the inhabitans were supposed to design their every day life.</p1>

    <h1>Supply Offer</h1>
    <p2>The following section will describe how the supply structure was originally planned and how it looks like today. Let's see, how the supply offer has changed.</p2>
    <h2>How was the local supply planned?</h2>

    <p2>In contrast to the largely unplanned settlements of the satellite towns, in the Plano Piloto, especially in Asa
      Sul and Asa Norte, there were precise plans for the local supply of the inhabitants. In the so-called
      "superquadras"(SQ), or rather in the communities of four superquadras “Unidade de Vizinhança” (UdV), there were
      schools, medical facilities, playgrounds, clubs, swimming pools, gyms, as well as small stores with local supply
      possibilities (Madanelo 1996, p. 276). Most of the supply was to be covered by small local commercial areas with,
      for example, bakeries and butcher shops (Tattara 2011, p. 52ff.) These are located in the “Comércio Local” (CL). A
      CL is always located between the two adjacent SQ.
      A very closely related theory is Walter Christaller's theory of central places. This theory deals with consumption
      and spatial planning. Basically, the theory describes how area-wide supply of the population with goods can be
      implemented in the shortest possible distances. It explains how supply centers are formed and how they relate to
      each other. The theory is based on the homo economicus approach. According to this, a person always possesses all
      the information and decides in favor of the offer that makes the most sense (Popp 2020, p.76).
    </p2>

    <h2>What does local supply look like today?</h2>

    <p3>
      Compared to the 1960s, when the life in Plano Piloto began, society and especially consumer behavior has changed
      drastically. Even in Plano Piloto, today's supply structures look different to some extent. In order to determine
      the current local supply structures, the Method of mapping was chosen.
      With this method, current structures of the local supply system could be traced. The evaluations of the mapping
      show that the CLs are still present. In addition, there are shopping centers that are used by the residents. The
      CLs differed from each other in their specialization. Some CLs have a focus on clothing, specialty items or
      restaurants, while others are largely heterogeneous.
      The analysis of UdV 107/307 & 108/308 Sul, for example, shows that Clothing and Other retail predominates (see the
      figure below) and in restaurants predominate in UdV 202/402 & 203/403 Norte. (Data not avaiable)
      In addition, it could be determined that the condition of the CLs differ. Based on the price range of the
      restaurants and stores and the number of vacancies, the economic position of the CL can be concluded.


    </p3>


    <h3>What has changed? Interpretation</h3>

    <p4>
      In summary, it can be noted that the local supply system has changed a lot, but in Plano Piloto the basic
      structures have been preserved until today. CL can still be seen as supply centers, following the central places
      theory, with the shopping centers increasingly competing. The range of services offered within the CLs varies
      greatly, but basic services are still available in each of the CLs we studied. It was also noticeable that there
      was no economic disparity in more distant CLs. Vacancies could be observed everywhere. In conclusion, the supply
      offer in the Plano Piloto has increased, specialized in some places and is increasingly controlled by the shopping
      centers. In addition, the importance of supermarkets, which now bundle most of the local supply, has changed
      considerably. Every UdV has at least one large supermarket. Here, the results of our analysis overlap with those
      of Bezerra and Agner (2021). Following our hypotheses, it can be stated that a long-term planning of the local
      supply with a general master plan is not possible and is strongly influenced by social change. Furthermore, it has
      been shown that the supply structure within Destrito Federal is very heterogeneous. See here the supply in the
      satellite town of Aguas Claras (link).

    <h1>Supply Demand</h1>
    <p2>We've already learned about the supply structure in Plano Piloto and how it has changed. We've been focusing on how the inhabitantts use this supply offer. Let's see, if the offer is used as originally planned.</p2>
    <h4> Data collection
    </h4>

    <p5>
      Besides looking at the development of the supply structure in the Plano Piloto, a second focus was set on the
      demand inhabitants concerning main supply. This includes for example where and how inhabitants of the Plano Piloto
      are going grocery shopping, having lunch, and doing other basic supply activities nowadays.
      Therefore, two different methods were practiced: </p5>
    <div class="tooltip">questionnaires<span class="tooltiptext"> The questionnaires were handed out to students of the
        UNB who live in Plano Piloto such as random pedestrians we’ve met while mapping the CLs. The total number of
        filled out questionnaires is six, three men and three women in the age between 23 and 65. The questionnaire
        contained five open questions, one drawing section for a mental map ending with some demographic questions about
        age, gender, living situation, number of people living in the same apartment and if they are working and/or
        studying.
        This method could provide an overview of different opinions and practices. Anyways, with only six people
        answering in total, we can’t take any conclusions for general habits out of the results. In order to still use
        the filled-out questionnaires, all answers were collected and sorted into a table which provides an overview of
        different habits concerning each topic of the questions asked. The mental maps were analyzed and compared. Some
        of them are displayed in the following section.
      </span></div>
    <p5>and </p5>
    <div class="tooltip">trackings<span class="tooltiptext">The trackings were practiced by four people living in Plano
        Piloto. Three male and one female between 23 and 35 years old. They were given an account for an app called
        Strava. With this app, people are usually tracking their sport activities (e.g., for running: route, distance,
        speed, elevation, heart rate). For this study the focus was only on the route. After setting up their smartphone
        with the Strava app and given account, they started a tracking activity on Strava but continued their everyday
        life just as they would without tracking. The tracking was active for four days with breaks at night. The
        participants could also stop and start the tracking at any time and any place if they wanted to. These trackings
        resulted into exportable routes about the movement of the tracked people. Like this it’s possible to see, if
        they go to the same CL every day, to different CLs around their SQ and further away, if they leave Plano Piloto,
        if they stop at a supermarket while on their way from A to B, etc. The following map shows the different tracks
        of the four participants during their four days of tracking.</span></div>
    <p5>.
      Using the answers of the questionnaires, four different categories can be formed. The focuses on the type of
      market where people are going to for grocery shopping. Even in the small number of participants, a wide variety of
      locations can be determined. This includes the mentions of local organic markets, organic weekly fairs, bakeries,
      shops in the nearby CL, supermarkets and even wholesale. As answers to the question, how they would choose the
      location for grocery shopping, the participants mentioned the quality, price, availability of parking spots and
      short distances to their apartment. Another questions was asking where the participants are eating their main
      meals. The answers are ranging from eating at home, cooking at home and taking it with them during the day to fast
      food, eating at restaurants depending on the day and using the cafeteria at university. As a fourth question, the
      relevance of ordering food online was queried. One of the participants stated that ordering food online is very
      important. The other answers stated a lower relevance with statements like “only if time is short”, “only if money
      is left” or “only out of convenience”.
      By drawing a mental map, the participants were asked to display where they are buying their supplies in relation
      to their home, how they move between shopping and home as well as how much time it takes them to get to different
      places. (Bild) This mental map presents that the person is living in a building from where it takes 5 minutes to
      get to a supermarket and 5 minutes in the opposite direction to get to the chosen drugstore. (Bild) This person’s
      mental map shows the name of a big supermarket “Atacadao” as well as organic fairs in the middle of the map as a
      main focus. The cloud in the top right corner shows that it takes the person about 20 minutes to get to the
      shopping places. The cloud on the bottom left side says that the person is covering the distances by foot. In the
      cloud in the bottom right corner types of products are listed such as food, hygiene products and cleaning
      supplies. (Bild) This map shows the word “carro” in the center as a focus which means car. All words around this
      (fruits, vegetables, organic fairs, supermarkets, Atacadao, perishable and non-perishable food) are connected with
      each other through the word “car”. This indicates a regular usage of a car to purchase supplies.
      Through the tracking method, the idea that was already given by the mental maps could be stated more precisely.
      Four participants tracked their everyday life for four days with an App on their Smartphone. The purpose of this
      method was to see, how far and where people living in Plano Piloto are moving during their everyday life to
      accomplish everything necessary. The following map shows the routes of all four participants. The fact that none
      of the participants left Plano Piloto during the tracking is very striking. The green track has the most diverse
      route whereas the red track is mainly commuting between two different areas of the Plano Piloto. The blue track is
      the only one that’s actually been in Asa Sul and Asa norte even though the spot in asa norte is at the University
      which doesn’t have a main focus in this study. The yellow track shows the least movement.
