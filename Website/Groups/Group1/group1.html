    <h8>Urbanity: Urban living in a made city</h8>
  </header>
  <main>

    <p1> What forms of space appropriation are visible at Plano Piloto and in what way can the construct of planned,
      produced space create urbanity? How is space appropriation and urbanity happening at selected places? These
      questions arose when the research about Brasília and its core, the Plano Piloto, started. One of the first
      difficulties within the research process was the eurocentric view by the student researchers on the construct of a
      city. Therefore, this had to constantly be kept in mind, since it would have compromised a neutral research
      process. </p1>

    <h1>Theory</h1>

    <p2>The concept of urbanity is diverse and hard to define, though the sole judgement by the size of a city (number
      of citizens & squaremeter) is not enough (Wirth 2020). Urbanity translates as the cognitive construct, the
      collective identity of a place and lifestyles that evolve from that. Within that context, the city of Brasília
      stands out. A planned city as the new capital of a new evolving state, a promise to society for better days to
      come. However, the Brasília of today struggles with uncontrolled growth and spatial segregation, which makes it
      almost impossible to live a life without a car since the planning based on the separation of social functions. The
      aspiration to build a modern capital with new forms of community living with social integration failed, as
      nowadays the majority of citizens live in satellite cities up to 50 km away from the city centre, Plano Piloto
      (Cafrune 2016). Brazil was one of the first countries to legitimate the right to the city in a national law, the
      Estatuto da Cidade (Mengay and Pricelius 2011).
      Another factor of urbanity is the collective identity of a place, no matter if a city is defined by administrative
      standards or it being just a rural community. Again, Brasília stands out, not only within Brazil but globally. It
      is a place where people came to from all over the country to settle in this brandnew city in the middle of the
      cerrado, a dry plateau in the backcountry, with almost no infrastructure around. It was designed by Oscar Niemayer
      as a symbol of modern times to show the evolving modern brazilian society. Now, three generations later, one could
      expect to meet an identity of Brasília as a thriving and inspiring capital, not only the administrative heart of a
      huge country. However, old metropolitan centres like São Paulo or Rio de Janeiro still own the typical charisma of
      the brazilian city. This does not mean it does not exist in Brasília. But one has to look more closely and to
      always keep in mind the history of Brasília and how the society formed since the independency of Brazil (see
      History Section).
    </p2>

    <h2>Results and interpretation with theoretical reference</h2>

    <p3>
      Oscar Niemayer, the architect and Lúcio Costa, the urban planner behind the construction of Brasília, wanted to
      build an icon of the modernity to manifest the evolving Brazilian society of the modern era. The planning of
      Brasília was based on the separation of social functions, at the time considered as the most modern way of living,
      and the role of Brasília as the prestigious new capital. The modern society - as Niemayer perceived it - was based
      on the access to modern technology, which at the times meant to be able to use the car without limitation (see
      History Section). The segregation of the Brazilian society of today is based on the limited access to functions
      because of limited means, which can be seen in the use of public transport by lower income groups and the
      domination of the informal sector in the Rodoviária (central bus / metro station) in contrast to the Conjunto
      National (shopping mall) <a class="link_name" href="/Website/Groups/Group5/group5.html">(see Transport
        Section)</a></li>. With the change of global societies through raised environmental
      awareness and the breakup of social norms and values all over the world, Brasília seems like a remnant of the
      modern times of acceleration. The transition to the postmodern times of today needs yet to be implemented but is
      bound by the planning of Niemayer/Costa. One could say that Brasília as an icon of modernity does not serve the
      postmodern society of nowadays Brazil anymore and only fortifies the growing segregation within the society
      (Kaiser 1987, Wehrhahn 1998, Struck 2017).
      Due to the decentralization of the city by the separation of functions, it is difficult to constitute an actual
      core of the city in the Plano Piloto. During the research progress, it was concluded to see a core of Brasília in
      the tricentre of the Rodoviária, the Conic Brasília (a cultural and shopping centre) and the Conjunto National on
      the one hand and on the other hand, the Vila Planalto neighbourhood. The following results are based on the work
      with a mix of methods used in the fieldwork.
      <br><br>
      Making urbanity comprehensible is not easy. The concept of the city within the city according to Ungers and
      Kolhaas (1977) describes a polycentric form of organisation, an ‘archipelago‘ of differences, so to speak, which
      favours urbanity. According to this, today's cities cannot be understood as a whole, but as a complex structure
      with many different ‘islands‘, which all have different characters. Urbanity thus meets in condensed form in the
      ‘islands‘. If we apply this concept to Brasília, we can identify various ‘islands‘. On the one hand, the area
      around the Rodoviária, the Conic Brasília and the Conjunto National can be identified as a special place for
      urbanity. In addition, the Vila Planalto neighbourhood is of great relevance considering its history as a former
      construction worker district. It is known as one of the most diverse neighbourhoods in Brasília. This applies to
      the income differences and diversity of the residents as well as the architecture. Urbanity is often associated
      with diversity, so Vila Planalto is an appealing neighbourhood for research. Through the method of strollology/
      walking (see methods chapter and map), this impression was consolidated. Important aspects of urbanity are
      therefore the human presence and interaction, green spaces and consumption opportunities, as well as the
      subcultural influence and diversity (see diagram). Attributes that were mentioned in connection with urbanity were
      ‘dense/full‘ or ‘diverse/different‘. At the same time, however, Vila Planalto was also described as ‘familiar,
      upper-class and chic‘ as well as ‘quiet, stress-free and pleasant‘ (see diagram). This discrepancy shows how
      different the neighbourhood is or is perceived to be. When looking <a class="link_name"
        href="/Website/pages/map/map.html">at the map</a></li>, some photos which were taken during
      the walks are shown and explained in a wider context.
      In summary, Vila Planalto is one of the rare places where the inhabitants successfully fought the destruction by
      the government. Within the ‘island‘ of Vila Planalto individualism, participation, space appropriation and
      subculture are quite visible which indicates a vivid urban life. Although different perceptions such as emptyness
      or chicness underline the diversity and complexity of the area. In contrast to other ‘islands‘ in Brasília Vila
      Planalto stands out in terms of a quite Western image of a neighbourhood as well as the understanding of urbanity
      including different architectural structures, restaurants, and life in public spaces. One could argue that it is
      the counterweight to the strictly planned area of the Plano Piloto which is also geographically very close to all
      central functions.à hier die Diagramme 1&2 einfügen (s.u. Kapitel 5).

      <br><br>
      Within the context of urbanity, keywords such as 'dense' and 'anonymous' are one of the main aspects on urban
      living. However, the Rodoviária (methods: observation and mapping) might seem as a place of futile exchanges
      between people, but it does serve as a regular meeting point not only for mobility but also consumption, since the
      informal sector is quite dominant here. The informal sector is tolerated, even though the authorities are present;
      it almost seems like as if there is a symbiotic co-existence. Moreover, knowing that the car is the dominant means
      of transport in Brasília, it can be concluded that this space is predominantly inhabited by people from lower
      income groups (Holanda 2022).
      The Conic Brasília (methods: mini-interview, mapping, walks) was once a place where urbanity was formed by
      strolling. Until the late 1980s, it was home to several small theatres, restaurants, pubs, cafés, etc. By Lucio
      Costa, it was meant to have the Mediterranean flair to spend the evenings in community. However, due to lack of
      financial investment, the sense of place changed, with sex work settling in vacant places. Today, restaurants or
      snack shops and a bar are visible in a few places. Otherwise, the place is dominated by vacancy, retail, party
      offices, churches, and private clinics. In addition, events such as concerts take place from time to time (Rossi
      2022). However, the Conic Brasília and its surroundings contain a security risk, especially in the evenings, which
      is counteracted in the semi-public Conjunto National by security guards and strict opening hours. The Conic
      Brasília and its surroundings stand out in the tricentre because of its subcultural character, which can be seen
      in the numerous graffitis and murals (Conic_7a, Conic_7b). àHier dann die Fotos einfügen
      The third point of the core, the Conjunto National (methods: walks), could be the most inviting place to stroll
      around for the following reasons. As a shopping centre it seems to be a place of only consumption, however, the
      compulsion to buy does not exist. Furthermore, it is a secure and climatized place to stroll around, meet friends
      or spend the lunch break. Technically, it is not a public space, since there are rules and security, but in a
      segregated country like Brazil this could be a factor for the appeal of secured, semi-public places like the
      Conjunto National. The combination of security, air-conditioning of the interior, the visual diversity of the
      shops and the restaurant level give people the opportunity to spend a whole day as a leisure activity (Rückert
      2002). Compared to the Rodoviária, the informal sector is completely absent in the Conjunto National, which allows
      to conclude that it is used in average possibly by higher income groups. However, this would have to be further
      investigated.
      <br><br>
      This combination of colliding and coexisting of different ways of living make Brasília so special in its own way.
      Urbanity almost seems raw, like something that already put down roots, but got overtaken by the rapid evolution of
      society and new standards and needs of a modern city life so it struggles to grow and blossom. In conclusion,
      urbanity can be perceived in the different locations of the tricentre as well as in Vila Planalto. As a construct
      that distinguishes the urban from the rural, it is produced by the inhabitants of Brasília. Compared to European
      cities such as Amsterdam (see the Lévy model (2020)), urbanity is less related to a concrete centre and occurs
      selectively. Different groups of people and incomes create diverse forms and expressions of urbanity in various
      places (Salin 2020), some of which exist side by side, but separately from each other as ‘islands‘. In some
      places, political actionism as a sign of urbanity (Salin 2020) in the form of graffiti is also recognisable.
      Looking at each of these places in isolation, the time of day is an equally leading feature. At Rodoviária, the
      informal sector creates liveliness at daytime, while at the Conic Brasília, a bar creates urbanity at night,
      especially on weekends. Vila Planalto is highly frequented during lunchtime. Other places where urbanity can be
      perceived in Brasília are the Comércios Locais <a class="link_name" href="/Website/Groups/Group4/group4.html">(see
        Supply in Plano Piloto)</a></li>, or green spaces such as the Parque de
      Cidade (see Green Spaces).

    <h3>Methods and limitations of the methods</h3>

    <p4>
      In order to approach the question of spatial perception and use in regard to urbanity, a ‘strollology method‘ was
      used: specifically, the ‘continuous stop walking method‘ based on Schultz and van Etteger 2017. For this purpose,
      strolls were conducted in the area of Vila Planalto (see route on map). This area was chosen because of its
      relevance for urbanity, which was highlighted in the literature and in interviews with experts. The method was
      carried out on 25.04.2022 with five students. The first walk (from 10 a.m.) was carried out continuously and
      documented by writing down impressions and experiences afterwards. Then (from 12 p.m.), the same route was walked
      again. This time, however, breaks were taken at regular intervals to let the surroundings take effect and to
      document the experience with photos and notes. These notes and photos were then evaluated with quantitative
      analyses, visualised, and summarised. Some of them are shown on the map and in the diagrams above. The difficulty
      within this method was on the one hand the framing such as the time of day or weather conditions but also the
      eurocentric view on urbanity as European students and the limitation of the individual concentration span.
      Therefore, the subjectivity must be kept in mind, even though guiding questions were given to contain this aspect.
      For further research, walks on different days and times as well as more non-European-participants are recommended
      to expand the data.
      <br><br>
      The results for the tricentre are based on a mix of methods consisting of observations at the Rodoviária, mapping
      of the ground floor level of the Rodoviária as well as the ground floor level of the Conic Brasília and a
      mini-interview with Taína Rossi about the significance of the Conic Brasília. In addition, walks took place in
      both the Conic Brasília and the Conjunto National to gather further impressions.
      <br><br>
      At Rodoviária, a total of four covert, non-participatory observations (Thierbach and Petschick 2014) were made on
      two days (Saturday, 23.04.22 and Tuesday, 26.04.22) in the morning (from 10 a.m.) and afternoon (from 1:30 p.m.)
      for 60 minutes each. It was carried out by four people observing each time. For this, the students had an
      observation sheet with set categories. Some of the criteria are: characteristics of people, subcultural
      expression, appropriation of space, interaction. Supporting videos (on saturday at the section D; on tuesday at
      the section B) were taken showing the frequency of people (difference between morning and afternoon) as well as
      the presence of the informal sector.
      The mapping of the ground floor level of the Rodoviária was carried out on Saturday 23.04.22 around noon. It
      extends the results of the observations by the visual aspect (Olbrich et al. 2002). A limitation here is that the
      informal sector is only present at certain times of the day. This factor can be countered by labelling the dynamic
      elements, but these change both over a day and between the days of the week. Accordingly, not all elements are
      clearly ascertainable and thus only offer a snapshot. The mapping of the ground floor level of the Conic Brasília
      was done on Thursday, 28.04.22 at around lunchtime. Compared to the map of the Rodoviária, there are almost no
      dynamic elements (informal sector). Although this mapping is also only a snapshot, changes in terms of vacancy in
      parts of the building are easier to understand due to the building structure. As a supplement, the type of spatial
      use and the (comprehensible) price level were noted here. The mini-interview about the change in the meaning of
      the Conic Brasília with Taína Rossi took place on 28.04.22 and is based on three guiding questions. The answers
      are well coordinated with the questions, but the limitation lays in the lack of possible follow-up questions could
      not be asked ad hoc, but only separately. The results of the questions asked are within used for the
      interpretation of the Conic Brasília (see Results Section). Originally, an additional method was to conduct a
      photo-interview, where through the use of lime survey and a QR-Code, people could show their most frequent place
      through a photograph. Unfortunately, the participation was low, this might result from the technical inconvenience
      of not having a photograph at hand, so people did not complete the whole survey. This was adapted during the field
      trip (by also giving the option to just describe via text) but did not bring better results. As the Brazilian
      culture is very interactive, the one-way-character of conducting a survey on the smartphone with no counterpart
      might have been the cause of it to fail. Nevertheless, also mishaps teach something, so the lack of human
      interaction is to keep in mind while conducting surveys the digital way. In addition, the observation of the
      tricentre became much more important during the research progress, since we had to adjust our thinking and
      perception as Europeans all the time.
