    <h8>Leisure, open spaces and territorial protection <br>in the Distrito Federal</h8>
  </header>
  <main>

    <h2>Research Question and Topic</h2>

    <p1>The topic "Leisure, Open Spaces and Territorial Protection" in the Distrito Federal deals with the appropriation
      of certain spaces by the people. The main research questions arise from three different but interrelated
      sub-aspects that address different dimensions of "appropriating": The first step is to find out which open spaces
      are appropriated by the population of the Distrito Federal.<br>
      Based on the local reference, the question of who appropriates the open spaces of the Distrito Federal will take a
      look at the actors: Do residents from the satellite cities or from the Plano Piloto tend to spend time in
      different open spaces and are there any recognizable patterns? Finally, the question of how the population of the
      Distrito Federal appropriates open spaces and how access to these spaces differs between the residents of the
      satellite cities and the Plano Piloto will be explored. The study also aims to find out how the use of the
      different spaces is reflected in the daily life of the inhabitants.<br>
      Consequently, a synthesis of the three aspects will provide insights into whether equitable access is evident in
      the use of open spaces in Brasília or whether a privileging of the residents of the Plano Piloto becomes
      noticeable and what role territorial protection plays in this.

    </p1>

    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <h1>(Urban) Open Spaces</h1>

    <p>In general, open spaces can be divided into green spaces, leisure and recreational spaces, and other open spaces
      (Nöst 2019). The functions of an open space can be divided into the ecological (climatic cooling effect), economic
      (attractive design of the open space) and social (places for recreation and leisure activities) functions (Hartz
      2018).<br>
      In times of digitalization, open spaces create important opportunities for interpersonal contact (Schwarting &
      Frisch 2012) that can counteract the isolation of society through shared use (Johnson & Glover 2013).
    </p>

    <h1>Green and Blue Spaces</h1>

    <p>
      At the macro level, the blue-green space is composed of blue space, i.e. all water areas, and green space, i.e.
      all green areas that shape the landscape pattern of the city (Wu, He & Yang 2020). Examples include the Parque
      Nacional de Brasília (PNB), which is part of the Cerrado and thus consists of an enormously large green space in
      the middle of which lies a lake (the Santa Maria reservoir) and is crisscrossed by rivers (Doyle 2009). Lago
      Paranoá is an artificial lake and probably the best known blue space in Brasília (Struck 2017/Epstein 1973). The
      Parque da Cidade also offers extensive green and blue spaces and thus plays an important role in the recreational
      use of the population.
    </p>

    <h1>Leisure Time</h1>

    <p>
      The focus of our research is primarily on the leisure use of public, urban spaces. Public spaces in cities, for
      example streets, parks and squares, can provide important opportunities to meet, interact and mingle (Young
      2014/Lamond & Lashua 2021). Urban open spaces are increasingly taking on the function of individual and informal
      places for exercise and recreation (Krüger & Kreutz 2018).
    </p>

    <h1>Territorial Protection</h1>

    <p>
      The Distrito Federal is located in the Cerrado, which contains 36 protected areas, 12 of them are under full
      protection and 24 under sustainable use; 72 parks designated for leisure use and ecological observation, and three
      areas are under special protection: the Zoological Garden, the Botanical Garden and the Embrapa Cerrado Reserve.
      The Distrito Federal is a member of the Brazilian Network and the World Network of Biosphere Reserves through the
      Cerrado Biosphere Reserve - RBC-DF. The RBC-DF covers an area of approximately 230,000 hectares, or about 40
      percent of the territory of the Distrito Federal (Doyle 2009). It consists of five conservation units: the Águas
      Emendadas Ecological Station, the Jardim Botânico Ecological Station, the Brasília National Park, the IBGE
      Ecological Station, and the Água Limpa Farm (Brasília Ambiental - Governo do Distrito Federal 2019). However, the
      RBC-DF faces significant challenges. In the immediate vicinity of some protection units are either urban
      consolidation areas or urban areas with controlled uses (Doyle 2009). In addition, these areas are threatened by
      invasions and irregular occupations, illegal forest clearance, trash, forest fires and more (Brasília Ambiental -
      Governo do Distrito Federal 2019). In addition, the population often does not know what a biosphere reserve is or
      that the RBC-DF exists or what its significance is (Doyle 2009).
    </p>

    <h2>Methods and Limitations of the Methods </h2>

    <p>
      The study group was collecting the data via photointerviews as well as interviews conducted with experts on
      different topics. The combination of those two methods allows to generate a greater base of information during the
      really restricted time in the vast area of Brasília. According to these two barriers, it was not possible to visit
      many more of the so-called satellite cities or administration regions. Even if the combination of the methods has
      a positive impact on the range of our results, it was nonetheless not complicated to gain an extremely deep
      insight into people’s leisure activities and how they appropriate space through their activities.<br>
      One might identify the language to communicate to each other as a barrier, due to a lack of portuguese on the side
      of the study group and some difficulties to express oneself in English by the counterparts. Language has also been
      a topic through the series of interviews conducted with different experts. Some of them have been fluent in
      English and surprisingly even once in German. Since the study group took the chance to prepare questions in
      Portuguese – similar to the other format of interviews – and the supporting translations by Univ.-Prof. Dr. Coy it
      was possible to gain some very detailed information on a wide range of the different topics.

    <h2>Results and Interpretation with Reference to Theory </h2>

    <p>
      The subject of "Leisure, Open Spaces and Territorial Protection" in the Distrito Federal does not only cover the
      three already mentioned interrelated subaspects but it also refers to the discussion of how the production and
      appropriation of space occurs in Brasília, an icon of modernity. The question of appropriation is deeply connected
      to this research topic. When it comes to the discussion about who is appropriating spaces, the study group noticed
      that all of Brasília’s population somehow is taking part. Though, the interesting point about it, is the way how
      different parts of the population are appropriating space. First of all, people who live outside of Plano Piloto
      tend to spend their time in parks there only at weekends and/or if they have enough time to get there, since it is
      a long way to go using public transportation. Beside distances, a weak network of public transportation,
      restricted opening hours in some parks can be seen as a barrier which is mainly encountered by people living
      outside of Plano Piloto. Another problem of using free green spaces is the lack of information about them and the
      lack of space at all. The urbanistic concept of satellite cities is poor in terms of infrastructure, trees and
      overall environmental quality in green areas. Expanded infrastructure is only found in rich areas like Plano
      Piloto, Águas Claras or Asa Sul and Asa Norte. To solve these problems it requires cooperations with poorer
      communities to co-build, occupy and promote infrastructures. Maria Rossi (Secretariat of Environment, Governo do
      Distrito Federal, Brasília) emphasized, that the concept of “public” is misunderstood - it is the synonym of
      “nobody”. But as you start involving people in a process, they feel more connected to certain places. In addition,
      the interviews conducted with students made clear, that people use public space differently to what it was meant
      to be. A concrete example is playing rugby at a big green area at the “eixo monumental”, the central axis. There
      was no area planned for free public use. This shows, that planned as well as not planned appropriation differs
      from initial plans. The interview with Maria Rossi showed, that areas in Brasília are under human pressure for
      occupation. An employee of the Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (icmbio) illustrated this northeast of the Parque Nacional (see Figure 1). A very common process in whole Brazil is the construction of houses without permissions or altercation
      in advance. This phenomenon is spread through all socioeconomic patterns, from poor to rich. A counterexample is
      the satellite city Samambaia, where much of the ownership of the land belonged to the government, so the building
      process was rather political.<br>
      To put it in a nutshell, the kind of appropriation varies by the interests of different castes. Furthermore, there
      are different time spans of appropriation. It can be spontaneous only for some leisure activities or a longterm
      period when it comes to illegal housing at the National Park as well as trying to expand the private parcell in a
      way to reach Lago Paranoá. These disparities between the upper class and low-/ middle class, between residents of
      Plano Piloto and most of the administration regions underline open space in Brasília as being a non-democratic,
      fragmented good.
