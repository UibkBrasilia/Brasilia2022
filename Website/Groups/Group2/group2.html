  </header>
  <main>

    <p1>The topic "Leisure, Open Spaces and Territorial Protection" in the Distrito Federal deals with the appropriation
      of certain spaces by the people. The main research questions arise from three different but interrelated
      sub-aspects that address different dimensions of "appropriating": The first step is to find out which open spaces
      are appropriated by the population of the Distrito Federal.
      Based on the local reference, the question of who appropriates the open spaces of the Distrito Federal will take a
      look at the actors – do residents from the satellite cities or from the Plano Piloto tend to spend time in
      different open spaces and are there any recognizable patterns? Finally, the question of how the population of the
      Distrito Federal appropriates open spaces and how access to these spaces differs between the residents of the
      satellite cities and the Plano Piloto will be explored. The study also aims to find out how the use of the
      different spaces is reflected in the daily life of the inhabitants.
      Consequently, a synthesis of the three aspects will provide insights into whether equitable access is evident in
      the use of open spaces in Brasília or whether a privileging of the residents of the Plano Piloto becomes
      noticeable and what role territorial protection plays in this.
    </p1>

    <h1>(Urban) Open Spaces</h1>

    <p2>In general, open spaces can be divided into green spaces, leisure and recreational spaces, and other open spaces
      (Nöst 2019: 10). The functions of an open space can be divided into the ecological (climatic cooling effect),
      economic (attractive design of the open space) and social (places for recreation and leisure activities) functions
      (Hartz 2018: 719 f.).
      <br>In times of digitalization, open spaces create important opportunities for interpersonal contact
      (Schwarting/Frisch 2012: 14) that can counteract the isolation of society by through shared use (Johnson/Glover
      2013: 191).

    </p2>

    <h2>Green and blue Spaces</h2>

    <p3>
      At the macro level, the blue-green space is composed of blue space, i.e. all water areas, and green space, i.e.
      all green areas that shape the landscape pattern of the city (Wu/He/Yang 2020: 31). Examples include the Parque
      Nacional de Brasília (PNB), which is part of the Cerrado and thus consists of an enormously large green space in
      the middle of which lies a lake (the Santa Maria reservoir) and is crisscrossed by rivers (Doyle 2009: 19). Lago
      Paranoá is an artificial lake and probably the best known blue space in Brasília (Struck 2017: 24/Epstein 1973).
      The Parque da Cidade also offers extensive green and blue spaces and thus plays an important role in the
      recreational use of the population.
    </p3>

    <h3>Leisure time</h3>

    <p4>
      The focus of our research is primarily on the leisure use of public, urban spaces. Public spaces in cities, for
      example streets, parks and squares, can provide important opportunities to meet, interact and mingle (Young 2014:
      250-251 & Lamond/Lashua 2021: 5). Urban open spaces are increasingly taking on the function of individual and
      informal places for exercise and recreation (Krüger/Kreutz 2018: 15).
    </p4>

    <h4>Territorial protection</h4>

    <p5>
      The Distrito Federal is located in the Cerrado, which contains 36 protected areas, 12 of them are under full
      protection and 24 under sustainable use; 72 parks designated for leisure use and ecological observation, and three
      areas are under special protection: the Zoological Garden, the Botanical Garden and the Embrapa Cerrados Reserve.
      The Distrito Federal is a member of the Brazilian Network and the World Network of Biosphere Reserves through the
      Cerrado Biosphere Reserve - RBC-DF. The RBC-DF covers an area of approximately 230,000 hectares, or about 40
      percent of the territory of the Distrito Federal (Doyle 2009: 17). It consists of five conservation units: the
      Águas Emendadas Ecological Station, the Jardim Botânico Ecological Station, the Brasília National Park, the IBGE
      Ecological Station, and the Água Limpa Farm (Companhia de Planejamento do Distrito Federal 2020: 42). However, the
      RBC-DF faces significant challenges. In the immediate vicinity of some protection units are either urban
      consolidation areas or urban areas with controlled uses (Doyle 2009: 20 f.). In addition, these areas are
      threatened by invasions and irregular occupations, illegal forest clearance, trash, forest fires and more
      (Companhia de Planejamento do Distrito Federal 2020: 42). In addition, the population often does not know what a
      biosphere reserve is or that the RBC-DF exists or what its significance is (Doyle 2009: 22).

    <h5>Ergebnisse und Interpretation mit Theoriebezug</h5>

    <p6>
      The subject of "Leisure, Open Spaces and Territorial Protection" in the Distrito Federal does not only cover the
      three already mentioned interrelated subaspects but it also refers to the discussion of how the production and
      appropriation of space occurs in Brasília, an icon of modernity. The question of appropriation is deeply connected
      to this research topic. When it comes to the discussion about who is appropriating spaces, the study group noticed
      that all of Brasília’s population somehow is taking part. Though, the interesting point about it, is the way how
      different parts of the population are appropriating space. First of all, people who live outside of Plano Piloto
      tend to spend their time in parks there only at weekends and/ or if they have enough time to get there, since it
      is a long way to go using public transportation (könnten wir direkt mit dem Thema der anderen Gruppe verlinken).
      Beside distances, a weak network of public transportation, restricted opening hours in some parks can be seen as a
      barrier which is mainly encountered by people living outside of Plano Piloto. Another problem of using free green
      spaces is the lack of information about them and the lack of space at all. The urbanistic concept of satellite
      cities is poor in terms of infrastrucutre, trees and overall environmental quality in green areas. Expanded
      infrastructure is only found in rich areas like Plano Piloto, Aguas claras or Asa Sul and Norte. To solve these
      problems it requires cooperations with poorer communities to co-build, occupy and promote infrastructures. Maria
      Rossi emphasized, that the concept of “public” is misunderstood - it is the synonym of “nobody”. But as you start
      involving people in a process, they feel more connected to certain places. In addition, the interviews conducted
      with students made clear, that people use public space differently to what it was ment to be. A concrete example
      is playing rugby at a big green area at the “eixo monumental”, the central axis. As already mentioned in segment
      2.1, Bose wrote that there was no area planned for free public use. This shows, that planned as well as not
      planned appropriation differs from initial plans. An Interview with Maria Rossi showed, that areas in Brasilia are
      under human pressure for occupation. A very common process in whole brazil is the construction of houses without
      permissions or altercation in advance. This phenomenon is spread through all socioeconomic patterns, from poor to
      rich. A counterexample is the satellite city Samambaia, where much of the ownership of the land belonged to the
      government, so the building process was rather political.
      <br><br>To put it in a nutshell, the kind of appropriation varies by the interests of different castes.
      Furthermore, there are different time spans of appropriation. It can be spontaneous only for some leisure
      activities or a longterm period when it comes to illegal housing at the National Park as well as trying to expand
      the private parcell in a way to reach Lago Paranoa. These disparities between the upper class and low-/ middle
      class, between residents of Plano Piloto and most of the admistration regions underline open space in Brasília as
      being a non-democratic, fragmented good.

    <h6>Mehtoden und Grenzen der Methoden </h6>

    <p7>
      As already mentioned, the study group was collecting the data via photointerviews as well as interviews conducted
      with experts on different topics. The combination of those two methods allows to generate a greater base of
      information during the really restricted time in the vast area of Brasília. According to these two barriers, it
      was not possible to visit many more of the so-called satellite cities or administration regions. Even if the
      combination of the methods has a positive impact on the range of our results, it was nonetheless not complicated
      to gain an extremely deep insight into people’s leisure activities and how they appropriate space through their
      activities.
      <br><br>One might identify the language to communicate to each other as a barrier, due to a lack of portuguese on
      the side of the study group and some difficulties to express oneself in English by the counterparts. Language has
      also been a topic through the series of interviews conducted with different experts. Some of them have been fluent
      in English and surprisingly even once in German. Since the study group took the chance to prepare questions in
      Portuguese – similar to the other format of interviews – and the supporting translations by Univ.-Prof. Dr. Coy it
      was possible to gain some very detailed information on a wide range of the different topics.
